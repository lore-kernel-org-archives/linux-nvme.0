We finally got around to retesting this (on hisi_sas controller). So the 
results are generally ok, in that we are now not seeing such big 
performance drops in our hardware for enabling SCSI MQ - in some 
scenarios the performance is better. Generally fio rw mode is better.

Anyway, for what it's worth, it's a green light from us to set SCSI MQ 
on by default.
