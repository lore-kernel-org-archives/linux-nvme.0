As I wrote in an earlier reply, it would be a lot cleaner to just have
the buckets be:

	buckets[2][BUCKETS_PER_RW];

and not have to do weird math based on both size and data direction.
Just have it return the bucket index based on size, and have the caller
do:

	bucket[rq_data_dir(rq)][bucket_index];
