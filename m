Can we get a proper GPLv2/GPLv2 license for this from the Intel
layers?  While the license grant looks fine from a quick look I'd really
prefer to have an official statement that this should be compatible
with the kernel licensing.

These are the SPC4 security protocol defintions, aren't they?
Can you please add a separate include/scsi/sec_protocol.h header that
defines just these and documents where they come from?

Similarly for all the other constants it would be nice to refer to
the spec they are from in the header.

please use lower case names for all arguments and variables.
