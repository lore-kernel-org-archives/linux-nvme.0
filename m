No one says every P2P use has to use P2P memory. Doorbells are obviously 
not P2P memory. But it's the p2mem interface that's important and the 
interface absolutely does not belong in the NVMe driver. Once you have 
the P2P memory interface you need an allocator behind it and the obvious 
place is in the P2P code to handle the common case where you're just 
mapping a BAR. We don't need to implement a genalloc in every driver 
that has P2P memory attached with it. If some hardware wants to expose 
memory that requires complicated allocation it's up to them to solve 
that problem but that isn't enough justification, to me, to push common 
code into every driver.

And we have out of tree code that uses the generic allocator part of 
p2pmem.

See the first P2PMEM RFC. We used Chelsio's NIC instead of the CMB with 
a very similar allocation scheme. We'd still be enabling that NIC in the 
same way if we didn't run into hardware issues with it. A simple BAR 
with memory behind it is always going to be the most common case.
