Hey all,

Indeed I attempted to convert nvme to use irq-poll (let's use its
new name) but experienced some unexplained performance degradations.

Keith reported a 700ns degradation for QD=1 with his Xpoint devices,
this sort of degradation are acceptable I guess because we do schedule
a soft-irq before consuming the completion, but I noticed ~10% IOPs
degradation fr QD=32 which is not acceptable.

I agree with Jens that we'll need some analysis if we want the
discussion to be affective, and I can spend some time this if I
can find volunteers with high-end nvme devices (I only have access
to client nvme devices.

I can add debugfs statistics on average the number of completions I
consume per intererupt, I can also trace the interrupt and the soft-irq
start,end. Any other interesting stats I can add?

I also tried a hybrid mode where the first 4 completions were handled
in the interrupt and the rest in soft-irq but that didn't make much
of a difference.

Any other thoughts?
