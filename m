It would be nice, but the driver doesn't know a request's completion
is going to be a polled. Even if it did, we don't have a spec defined
way to tell the controller not to send an interrupt with this command's
compeletion, which would be negated anyway if any interrupt driven IO
is mixed in the same queue. We could possibly create a special queue
with interrupts disabled for this purpose if we can pass the HIPRI hint
through the request.
