Totally agree. There is already some activity in T10 for a ZBC V2
standard which indeed may include new zone types (for instance a
"circular buffer zone type that can be sequentially rewritten without a
reset, preserving previously written data for reads after the write
pointer). Such type of zone could be a perfect match for an FS journal
log space for instance.

Absolutely. The initial zoned block device support was written to match
what ZBC/ZAC defines. It was simple this way and there was no other
users of the zone concept. But the device models and zone types are just
numerical values reported to the device user. The block I/O stack
currently does not use these values beyond the device initialization. It
is up to the users (e.g. FS) of the device to determine what to do to
correctly use the device according to the types reported. So this basic
design is definitely extensible to new zone types and device models.

Indeed. The ZBC case was simple as we matched the standard defined
models. Whihc in any case is not really used in any way directly by the
block I/O stack itself. Only upper layers use that.

In the case of ACSSD, this adds one hardware-defined model set by the
standard, plus a potential collection of software defined models through
different FTL implementations on the host. Getting these models and
there API right will be indeed tricky. In a first step, providing a
ZBC-like host-aware model and a host-managed model may be a good idea as
upper layer code already ready for ZBC disks will work out-of-the-box
for OCSSDs too. From there, I can see a lot of possibilities for more
SSD optimized models though.

The struct blk_zone type is 64B in size but only currently uses 32B. So
there is room for new fields, and existing fields can have newly defined
values too as the ZBC standard uses only few of the possible values in
the structure fields.

Thank you for the information. I will check this out. Is it the
optimization that aggressively delay meta-data update by allowing
reading of meta-data blocks directly from the journal (for blocks that
are not yet updated in place) ?

Emulators may indeed be very useful for development. But we could also
go further and implement the different models using device mappers too.
Doing so, the same device could be used with different FTL through the
same DM interface. And this may also simplify the implementation of
complex models using DM stacking (e.g. the host-aware model can be
implemented on top of a host-managed model).

Best regards.
