I don't know about this. I feel like blk-mq owns these flags and LLD's
shouldn't require such knowledge of their implementation details.

I understand how the problems are happening a bit better now. It used
to be that blk-mq would lock an expired command one at a time, so when
we had a batch of IO timeouts, the driver was able to complete all of
them inside a single IO timeout handler.

That's not the case anymore, so the driver is called for every IO
timeout even though if it reaped all the commands at once.

IMO, the block layer should allow the driver to complete all timed out
IOs at once rather than go through ->timeout() for each of them and
without knowing about the request state details. Much of the problems
would go away in that case.

But I think much of this can be fixed by just syncing the queues in the
probe work, and may be a more reasonable bug-fix for 4.17 rather than
rewrite the entire timeout handler. What do you think of this patch? It's
an update of one I posted a few months ago, but uses Jianchao's safe
namespace list locking.
