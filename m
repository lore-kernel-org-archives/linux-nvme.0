If per-controller block device nodes are hidden, how can the user-space tools
such as multipath-tools and nvme-cli (if it supports) know status of each path of
the multipath device?
In some cases, the admin wants to know which path is in down state , in degraded
state such as suffering intermittent IO error because of shaky link and he can fix
the link or isolate such link from the normal path.
