Subject: [PATCHv2 blktests] nvme: Add command timeout injection test
Message-ID: <20180514204241.15300-1-keith.busch@intel.com>

This test will run a background IO process and inject an admin command
with a very short timeout that is all but guaranteed to expire without
a completion: the async event request.

Signed-off-by: Keith Busch <keith.busch at intel.com>

v1 -> v2:

  Changed description since its not a test for a specific
  regression-fixing patch.

  Added fio requirement.

  Missing quotes around device name.
