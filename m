The addition of the supported bit is because the released version
of the ANA spec was buggy and didn't add the supported bit to the
oaes field.  This hasn't been fixed in an erratate and I dropped
the manual addition of the support, but I failed to remove the
local supported variable (which modulo the conflict actually makes
sense, but should indeed not have been part of the commit).
