Hmm, ok I just switched m->lock from spinlock_t to rwlock_t, see:
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=dm-4.6&id=a5226e23a6958ac9b7ade13a983604c43d232c7d

So any patch you'd have in this area would need rebasing.  I'll gladly
look at what you have (even if it isn't rebased).  So yes please share.

(it could be that there isn't a big enough win associated with switching
to rwlock_t -- that we could get away without doing that particular
churn.. open to that if you think rwlock_t pointless given we'll take
the write lock after repeat_count drops to 0)
