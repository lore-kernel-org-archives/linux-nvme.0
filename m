Uh oh - different transports for the same subsystem will be intereting.
For one it's not specified anywhere so I'd like to kick off a discussion
on the working group mailing list about it.

That being said ->make_request basically doesn't care about actual
limits at all, it mostly care about support features (e.g. discard, fua,
etc).  So I think a lot of these limits could porbably be lifted,
but I'd need to add the check to generic_make_request_checks back.

Yeah.  Maybe generic_make_request_direct or direct_make_request
is a better name as it describes the recursion avoidance bypassing
a little better.
