Subject: [PATCHv3 0/5] genhd: register default groups with device_add_disk()
Message-ID: <20180905070053.26239-1-hare@suse.de>

device_add_disk() doesn't allow to register with default sysfs groups,
which introduces a race with udev as these groups have to be created after
the uevent has been sent.
This patchset updates device_add_disk() to accept a 'groups' argument to
avoid this race and updates the obvious drivers to use it.
There are some more drivers which might benefit from this (eg loop or md),
but the interface is not straightforward so I haven't attempted it.

As usual, comments and reviews are welcome.

Changes to v2:
- Fold lightnvm attributes into the generic attribute group as
  suggested by Bart

Changes to v1:
- Drop first patch
- Convert lightnvm sysfs attributes as suggested by Bart

Hannes Reinecke (5):
  block: genhd: add 'groups' argument to device_add_disk
  nvme: register ns_id attributes as default sysfs groups
  aoe: use device_add_disk_with_groups()
  zram: register default groups with device_add_disk()
  virtio-blk: modernize sysfs attribute creation
