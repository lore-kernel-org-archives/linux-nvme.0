Yeah, disabling the device before calling "nvme_uninit_ctrl" shouldn't
be required. If you disable the device first, del_gendisk can't flush
dirty data on an orderly removal request.

I'm almost certain the remove_work shouldn't even be running in this
case. If the reset work can't transition the controller state correctly,
it should assume something is handling the controller.
