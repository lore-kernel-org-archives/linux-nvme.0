Thanks for the feedback!

This test does indeed toggle the Link Control Link Disable bit to simulate
the link failure. The PCIe specification specifically covers this case
in Section 3.2.1, Data Link Control and Management State Machine Rules:

  If the Link Disable bit has been Set by software, then the subsequent
  transition to DL_Inactive must not be considered an error.

So this test should suppress any Suprise Down Error events, but handling
that particular event wasn't the intent of the test (and as you mentioned,
it ought not occur anyway since the slot is HP Surprise capable).

The test should not suppress reporting the Data Link Layer State Changed
slot status. And while this doesn't trigger a Slot PDC status, triggering
a DLLSC should occur since the Link Status DLLLA should go to 0 when
state machine goes from DL_Active to DL_Down, regardless of if a Suprise
Down Error was detected.

The Linux PCIEHP driver handles a DLLSC link-down event the same as
a presence detect remove event, and that's part of what this test was
trying to cover.
