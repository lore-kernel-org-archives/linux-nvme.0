Sure, but my point is DM-mpath will no longer be able to provide the
ability to properly handle repeat_count > 1 (because updating the
->current_pgpath crushes the write-side of the RCU).

As such I've rebased 'devel3' to impose repeat_count = 1 (both in
dm-mpath.c and the defaults in each path selector).
