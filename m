I tried this on my QEMU VM, which apparently doesn't emulate this
command:

$ sudo ./check nvme/006
nvme/006 => nvme0n1 (test nvme admin command timeout handling with in-flight io) [failed]
runtime     ...  20.505s

Can this test use a loopback target like the nvme tests Johannes has
added recently?
