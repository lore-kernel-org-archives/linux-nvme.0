Subject: [PATCH 0/5] genirq/affinity: irq vector spread among online CPUs as
 far as possible
Message-ID: <20180206121742.29336-1-ming.lei@redhat.com>

Hi,

This patchset tries to spread among online CPUs as far as possible, so
that we can avoid to allocate too less irq vectors with online CPUs
mapped.

For example, in a 8cores system, 4 cpu cores(4~7) are offline/non present,
on a device with 4 queues:

1) before this patchset
	irq 39, cpu list 0-2
	irq 40, cpu list 3-4,6
	irq 41, cpu list 5
	irq 42, cpu list 7

2) after this patchset
	irq 39, cpu list 0,4
	irq 40, cpu list 1,6
	irq 41, cpu list 2,5
	irq 42, cpu list 3,7

Without this patchset, only two vectors(39, 40) can be active, but there
can be 4 active irq vectors after applying this patchset.

One disadvantage is that CPUs from different NUMA node can be mapped to
one same irq vector. Given generally one CPU should be enough to handle
one irq vector, it shouldn't be a big deal. Especailly more vectors have
to be allocated, otherwise performance can be hurt in current
assignment.

Thanks
Ming
