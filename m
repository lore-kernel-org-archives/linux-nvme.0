The series looks good to me,

BTW, if we talking about the reinit_tagset, can you explain the 
motivation for dereg_mr and alloc new mr for the RDMA transport layer ?
we don't do it in iSER/SRP so I wonder what is special here ?
I got some local protection errors in MP tests and under high load FIO 
(that cause cmd TMO to expire and abort the cmds and then reconnect).
I wonder if there is a connection between the two. I'm also debugging a 
situation that we might have free/dereg/local_invalidate the MR before 
the QP moved to ERR state.
