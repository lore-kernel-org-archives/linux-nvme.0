Yeah, in fact I think we HAVE to do it this way. I've been thinking about
this for a while, and ideally I'd really like blk-mq to support multiple
queue "pools". It's basically just a mapping thing. Right now you hand
blk-mq all your queues, and the mappings are defined for one set of
queues. It'd be nifty to support multiple sets, so we could do things
like "reserve X for polling", for example, and just have the mappings
magically work. blk_mq_map_queue() then just needs to take the bio
or request (or just cmd flags) to be able to decide what set the
request belongs to, making the mapping a function of {cpu,type}.

I originally played with this in the context of isolating writes on
a single queue, to reduce the amount of resources they can grab. And
it'd work nicely on this as well.

Completions could be configurable to where the submitter would do it
(like now, best for sync single thread), or to where you have a/more
kernel threads doing it (spdk'ish, best for high qd / thread count).
