Can't we make the multipath support invisible to the host?
IE check the shared namespaces before creating the device node, and just
move them under the existing namespaces if one exists?

Thing is, this device multiplication was (and is) the #1 objection to
dm-multipath, and we should be looking to avoid that if we do a new
implementation.
