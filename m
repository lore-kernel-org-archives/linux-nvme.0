One exception is PCI error recovery, in which EH_RESET_TIMER still
may be returned any time.

Also the two timeout can happen at the same time from more than one
NS, just before resetting is started(before updating to NVME_CTRL_RESETTING).

OR one timeout is from admin queue, another one is from NS, both happen
at the same time, still before updating to NVME_CTRL_RESETTING.

In above two situations, one timeout can be handled as EH_HANDLED, and
another can be handled as EH_RESET_TIMER.

So it isn't enough to drain timeout by blk_sync_queue() simply.
