Hmm, I can't say for certain but I would definitely expect any sane
compiler to do so. It's a fairly obvious optimization and the kbuild
robot is happy with it.

I just did a test compile on 4.9 (which is the earliest compiler version
I have readily available) and it worked fine. The minimum gcc the kernel
supports is 4.6 right now.

I've also done a similar test on godbolt.org[1] and can't find any
compiler version that doesn't work.
