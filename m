I see, I found it now. Guys, let's get this process streamlined a bit
more. This whole thing has been a flurry of patches and patchseries,
posted by either you or Jon. Previous patch series was 1-4 patches
posted by you, and then patch #4 is replaced by a single patch from Jon,
posted outside of that thread. Honestly, I feel like this should have
been pushed to 4.12 instead, it clearly wasn't ready before the merge
window.
