This warning is harmless, also you can't reproduce it without help of your
special patch, I guess, :-) So the window shouldn't be a big deal. 

But it can be a problem about the delay(msecs_to_jiffies(msecs)) passed to
kblockd_mod_delayed_work_on(), because during the period:

1) hctx->next_cpu can become online from offline before __blk_mq_run_hw_queue
is run, your warning is triggered, but it is harmless

2) hctx->next_cpu can become offline from online before __blk_mq_run_hw_queue
is run, there isn't warning, but once the IO is submitted to hardware,
after it is completed, how does the HBA/hw queue notify CPU since CPUs
assigned to this hw queue(irq vector) are offline? blk-mq's timeout
handler may cover that, but looks too tricky.

Thanks for sharing your reproduction approach.

Without a handler for CPU hotplug, it isn't easy to avoid the warning
completely in __blk_mq_run_hw_queue().

We have to fix the panic, so I will post the patch you tested in this thread.

Thanks,
