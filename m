Hi Bart,

This shouldn't be introducing any new concorrent calls to
__blk_mq_complete_request if they don't already exist. The timeout work
calls it only if the driver's timeout returns BLK_EH_HANDLED, which means
the driver is claiming the command is now done, but the driver didn't call
blk_mq_complete_request as indicated by the request's IN_FLIGHT state.

In order to get a second call to __blk_mq_complete_request(), then,
the driver would have to end up calling blk_mq_complete_request()
in another context. But there's nothing stopping that from happening
today, and would be bad if any driver actually did that: the request
may have been re-allocated and issued as a new command, and calling
blk_mq_complete_request() the second time introduces data corruption.

Thanks,
Keith
