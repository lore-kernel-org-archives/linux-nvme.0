No, I think that would be the preferable approach IFF patching the global
table of groups would be viable.  I don't think it is, though - we can
have both normal NVMe and LightNVM devices in the same system, so we
can't just patch it over.

So we'll need three different attribut group arrays:

const struct attribute_group *nvme_ns_id_attr_groups[] = {
	&nvme_ns_id_attr_group,
	NULL,
};

const struct attribute_group *lightnvm12_ns_id_attr_groups[] = {
	&nvme_ns_id_attr_group,
	&nvm_dev_attr_group_12,
	NULL,
};

const struct attribute_group *lightnvm20_ns_id_attr_groups[] = {
	&nvme_ns_id_attr_group,
	&nvm_dev_attr_group_20,
	NULL,
};

and a function to select which one to use.
