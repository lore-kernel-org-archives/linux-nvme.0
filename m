Thanks for the detailed explanation, and sorry for the slow reply.

I see your point now, and I agree that adding a generic HKDF implementation=
 probably would not buy us much here.
I can still see some value in having a shared, well-tested implementation, =
but I agree it=E2=80=99s probably not worth it in this case.

Thanks again for taking the time to review this.
