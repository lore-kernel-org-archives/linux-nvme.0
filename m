Subject: [PATCHv2 0/2] block: Discard merging fixes
Message-ID: <20180201203158.24761-1-keith.busch@intel.com>

This series fixes some incorrect accounting from merging discard requests.

The first patch fixes merging two discard requests by having a special
case for merging these using the unique constraints discards have.

The second fixes merging a new discard bio into an existing
request. Previously all the schedulers defaulted to a front merge,
so the  patch just checks merge type and adds a 'case' for handling
discard in each of the callers.

I've only been able to test with mq-deadline on NVMe as that is the only
driver currently supporting multiple discard ranges in a single command.

v1 -> v2: 

  Fixed patch 1 based on feedback from Jens, tested with recreate
  sequence.

  Added 2nd patch for merging discard bios into existing requests.
