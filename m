Hi Ming,

I'm developing the answers in code the issues you raised. It will just
take a moment to complete flushing those out. In the meantime just want
to point out why I think block/011 isn't a real test.

If this test actually simulates reality, then the following one line
patch (plus explanation for why) would be a real "fix" as this is very
successful in passing block/011. :)
