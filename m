Even if before tejun's patch, we also have this for both blk-mq and blk-legacy code.

blk_rq_check_expired

    if (time_after_eq(jiffies, rq->deadline)) {
        list_del_init(&rq->timeout_list);

        /*
         * Check if we raced with end io completion
         */
        if (!blk_mark_rq_complete(rq))
            blk_rq_timed_out(rq);
    } 
 

blk_complete_request
    
    if (!blk_mark_rq_complete(req))
        __blk_complete_request(req);

blk_mq_check_expired
    
    if (time_after_eq(jiffies, rq->deadline)) {
        if (!blk_mark_rq_complete(rq))
            blk_mq_rq_timed_out(rq, reserved);
    }


blk_mq_complete_request

    if (!blk_mark_rq_complete(rq))
        __blk_mq_complete_request(rq);

Thanks
