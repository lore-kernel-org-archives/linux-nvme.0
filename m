Yeah, I knew they'd be the primary sticking point for this patchset.
I'm not loving the need to carry the function pointer around either.

I initially didn't like the gotchas associated [1], but I worked through
them.

I'll post v2 after some testing.

Thanks,

[1]:
With DM multipath, it is easy to reliably establish the function
pointer.  But clearing it on teardown is awkward.. because another DM
multipath table may have already taken a reference on the device (as
could happen when reloading the multipath table associated with the DM
multipath device).  You are left with a scenario where a new table load 
would set it, but teardown wouldn't easily know if it should be cleared.
And not clearing it could easily lead to dereferencing stale memory
(if/when DM multipath driver were unloaded yet NVMe request_queue
outliving it).
