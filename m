Keith's comments made me realize something even deeper as well. Assuming the firmware
changed and we no longer support security commands we need to free the opal_dev structure
like we're doing but there is a possiblity that there were saved ranges in the structure
that we need to free as well.  If the user had previously told the kernel to unlock 5
ranges coming out of a suspend there are 5 structures we need to free inside the opal_dev
before we free the opal dev. We'll need to re-introduce free_opal_dev() in the opal code
like we had a while back.
