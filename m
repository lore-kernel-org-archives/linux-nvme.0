That's not quite what I was talking about.

Before, only the command that was about to be sent to the driver's
.timeout() was marked completed. The driver could (and did) compete
other timed out commands in a single .timeout(), and the tag would
clear, so we could hanlde all timeouts in a single .timeout().

Now, blk-mq marks all timed out commands as aborted prior to calling
the driver's .timeout(). If the driver completes any of those commands,
the tag does not clear, so the driver's .timeout() just gets to be called
again for commands it already reaped.
