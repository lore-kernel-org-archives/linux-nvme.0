I'm not sure what Christoph's proposal looks like, but I have to agree
that multipath support directly in the kernel without requiring user
space to setup the mpath block device is easier for everyone. The only
NVMe specific part, though, just needs to be how it reports unique
identifiers to the multipath layer.

Maybe I'm not seeing the bigger picture. Is there some part to multipath
that the kernel is not in a better position to handle?
