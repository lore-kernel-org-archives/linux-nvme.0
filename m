Subject: [GIT PULL] another round of nvme patches for kernel 4.13
Message-ID: <1499707012-19014-1-git-send-email-sagi@grimberg.me>

Hey Jens,

Another round of early patches for 4.13.

I added the quiesce/unquiesce patches in here as it's
easy for me easily apply changes on top. It has accumulated
reviews and includes mostly nvme anyway, please tell me if
you don't want to take them with this.

This includes:
- quiesce/unquiesce fixes in nvme and others from me
- nvme-fc add create association padding spec updates from James
- some more quirking from MKP
- nvmet nit cleanup from Max
- Fix nvme-rdma racy RDMA completion signalling from Marta
- some centralization patches from me
- add tagset nr_hw_queues updates on controller resets in
  nvme drivers from me
- nvme-rdma fix resources recycling when doing error recovery from me
- minor cleanups in nvme-fc from me

please consider pulling from:

  git://git.infradead.org/nvme.git nvme-4.13

It's rebased on top of your for-4.13/block.

Thanks!
