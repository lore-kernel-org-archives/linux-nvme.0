Then can you tell me why blk-mq's SCHED_RESTART can't cover
the rerun when there are in-flight requests? What is the case
in which dm-rq can return BUSY and there aren't any in-flight
requests meantime?

Also you are the author of adding 'blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queue(
hctx, 100/*ms*/)' in dm-rq, you never explain in commit
6077c2d706097c0(dm rq: Avoid that request processing stalls
sporadically) what the root cause is for your request stall
and why this patch fixes your issue. Even you don't explain
why is the delay 100ms?

So it is a workaound, isn't it?

My concern is that it isn't good to add blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queue(hctx, 100/*ms*/)
in the hot path since it should been covered by SCHED_RESTART
if there are in-flight requests.

Actually the improvement on dm-rq IO schedule(the patch 2 ~ 5) doesn't
need this patch.
