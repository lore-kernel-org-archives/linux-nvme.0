You've avoided discussing this on any level (and I guess you aren't
going to LSF/MM?).  Yet you're expecting to just drop it into the tree
without a care in the world about the implications.

Nobody has interest in Linux multipathing becoming fragmented.

If every transport implemented their own multipathing the end-user would
be amazingly screwed trying to keep track of all the
quirks/configuration/management of each.

Not saying multipath-tools is great, nor that DM multipath is god's
gift.  But substantiating _why_ you need this "native NVMe
multipathing" would go a really long way to justifying your effort.

For starters, how about you show just how much better than DM multipath
this native NVMe multipathing performs?  NOTE: it'd imply you put effort
to making DM multipath work with NVMe.. if you've sat on that code too
that'd be amazingly unfortunate/frustrating.
