Here's what I think - flag days tend to suck. They may be more convenient
for developers, but they inflict pain on users. Sometimes they prevent
them from moving forward, since updates are now gated on external
dependencies. Moving forward with a new architecture is great, but
proper care has to be given to existing users of multipath, regardless
of how few they may be.

This patchset seems pretty clean and minimalist. Realistically, I'm
guessing that SUSE and RH will ship it regardless of upstream status.
