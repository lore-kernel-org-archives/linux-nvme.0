But interestingly, with my "mptest" link failure test
(test_01_nvme_offline) I'm not actually seeing NVMe trigger a failure
that needs a multipath layer (be it NVMe multipath or DM multipath) to
fail a path and retry the IO.  The pattern is that the link goes down,
and nvme waits for it to come back (internalizing any failure) and then
the IO continues.. so no multipath _really_ needed:

It seems if we have multipath ontop (again: either NVMe native multipath
_or_ DM multipath) we'd prefer to have the equivalent of SCSI's
REQ_FAILFAST_TRANSPORT support?

But nvme_req_needs_retry() calls blk_noretry_request() which returns
true if REQ_FAILFAST_TRANSPORT is set.  Which results in
nvme_req_needs_retry() returning false.  Which causes nvme_complete_rq()
to skip the multipath specific nvme_req_needs_failover(), etc.

So all said:

1) why wait for connection recovery if we have other connections to try?
I think NVMe needs to be plumbed for respecting REQ_FAILFAST_TRANSPORT.

2) this avoidance of NVMe retries, or failover, in response to
REQ_FAILFAST_TRANSPORT seems exactly the opposite of desired behaviour
when multipath is available?

Thoughts?

Thanks,
Mike

p.s. given NVMe FC transport isn't letting go of the IO, not failing up
to NVMe core while "awaiting reconnect".. even if "keep-alive timer (15
seconds) expired": I hacked test coverage to verify the correctness and
stability of this patch's multipath_failover_rq() hook by testing
against a dm-flakey device (up 10 sec, down 10 sec) and applying this
patch:
