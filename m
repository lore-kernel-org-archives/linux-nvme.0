I really like how this is looking, but the pairing isn't coming out
right when I applied this on one of my test machines. I have 32 CPUs
and 31 MSI-x vectors, and this is the resulting blk-mq cpu list:

  # cat /sys/block/nvme0n1/mq/*/cpu_list
  0
  10
  11
  12
  13
  14
  15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9

Before, each mq hardware queue would have 2 CPUs, now it's terribly
unbalanced.

I'll look again tomorrow to make sure I didn't mess something up when
merging your tree, but just wanted to let you know now.
