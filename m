Oh.  This did indeed break with the bi_bdev -> bi_disk refactoring
I did just before sending this out.

For ANA we'll have to do that anyway, but if we got a failure
that clearly indicates a path failure what benefit is there in not
resetting the controller?  But yeah, maybe we can just switch the
path for non-ANA controllers and wait for timeouts to do their work.

Yes.  Previously this was opencoded and always used head->disk, but
I messed it up last minute.  In the end it still worked for my cases
because the controller would either already be reset or fail all
I/O, but this behavior clearly is not intended and suboptimal.
