Not to muddy the waters here, and as Mike said the issue he tripped
over may not be the direct issue we originally started with.

In the lab reproducer with rbd as a slow devices we do not have an MD
raided nvme for the dm-cache, but we still see the corruption only on
the rbd based test.

We used the nvme partitioned but no DM raid to try an F/C device-
mapper-multipath LUNS cached via dm-cache.

The last test we ran where we did not see corruption was a partition
where the second partition was used to cache F/C luns
