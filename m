Indeed, the test is simulating a permanently broken link, so recovery is
not expected. A success in this case is just completing driver
unbinding.

The above won't actually do anything here since the broken link puts the
controller in the DEAD state, so we've killed the queues which also
unquiesces them.

It's actually pretty easy to trigger this one. I just modify block/019 to
remove the check for a hotplug slot then run it on a block device that's
not hot-pluggable.
