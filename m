Sorry, no = should be used. you need either:
"queue_mode bio" or "queue_mode mq"

Added to the features section of the "multipath" ctr input.
AFAIK, once the above commit lands upstream Ben will be adding some
multipath-tools code to make configuring queue_mode easy (but I think
multipath.conf may allow you to extend the features passed on a
per-device basis already.. but I'd have to look).
