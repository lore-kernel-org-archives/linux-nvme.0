I'm happy with this approach.

FYI, I did recently invert the logic on dm-mpath.c:noretry_error() and
staged for 4.16, see:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=dm-4.16&id=806f913a543e30d0d608a823b11613bbeeba1f6d
But I can drop that patch and rebase accordingly.

Also, I think a better name for blk_path_failure() would be
blk_retryable_error()?  Don't feel that strongly about it though.

Don't think it needs to be a series, having it be a single patch shows
why it makes sense to elevate the retryable error check to block core.

But maybe Jens will be able to give you more guidance on what he'd like
to see.

I'd very much like to see this land in 4.16.

Thanks!
Mike
