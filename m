That's not really just NVMe - other storage and network controllers also
can DMA map giant amounts of memory.  There are a couple aspects to it:

 - dma coherent memoery - right now NVMe doesn't use too much of it,
   but upcoming low-end NVMe controllers will soon start to require
   fairl large amounts of it for the host memory buffer feature that
   allows for DRAM-less controller designs.  As an interesting quirk
   that is memory only used by the PCIe devices, and never accessed
   by the Linux host at all.

 - size vs number of the dynamic mapping.  We probably want the dma_ops
   specify a maximum mapping size for a given device.  As long as we
   can make progress with a few mappings swiotlb / the iommu can just
   fail mapping and the driver will propagate that to the block layer
   that throttles I/O.
