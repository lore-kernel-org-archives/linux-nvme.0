In general I am _not_ in favour of this approach.

This is essentially the same level of multipath support we had in the
old qlogic and lpfc drivers in 2.4/2.6 series, and it took us _years_ to
get rid of this.
Main objection here is that it will be really hard (if not impossible)
to use the same approach for other subsystems (eg SCSI), so we'll end up
having different multipath implementations depending on which subsystem
is being used.
Which really is a maintenance nightmare.

I'm not averse to having other multipath implementations in the kernel,
but it really should be abstracted so that other subsystems can _try_ to
leverage it.

Cheers,

Hannes
