Yep, mmiowb() is supposed to be used in this situation. According to BenH,
author of that io_sync hack, we implement the stronger semantics
so that we don't break existing drivers that assume spin_unlock() does
order i/o even though it's not supposed to. At a guess the x86 version of
spin_unlock() happens to do that so the rest of us need to either live
with it or fix all the bugs :)

Yeah this was my main concern with the whole approach. For ioremap()ed
memory we have the __iomem annotation to help with tracking when we
need to be careful, but we'd lose that entirely here.

It's a tricky problem. HMM with DEVICE_PRIVATE might be more
palatable than the pfn_t conversion since there would still be struct pages
backing the device memory. That said, there are probably other issues with
device private memory not being part of the linear mapping, but HMM
provides some assistance there.
