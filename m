No, that isn't a good description. If you take a look at the code a few
lines up you find:
	phys_addr = (sg_phys(s) & PAGE_MASK) + (j << PAGE_SHIFT);

Now if I am not mistaken the whole reason why you are having to make
the change here is because the application of PAGE_MASK in this line.
Basically what sg_phys() will do is take the address of the page,
convert it to a physical address and add the offset. However what the
mask is doing is limiting how much of that offset can be added. As a
result you have to add the remainder that was masked out. So maybe a
better comment would be something like:

/*
 * Add in the remaining piece of the scatter-gather offset that was 
 * masked out when we were determining the physical address via
 * (sg_phys(s) & PAGE_MASK) earlier.
 */
