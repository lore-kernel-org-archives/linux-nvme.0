The polling do not update the cqe_seen. So it's possible that every time
the IRQ handler does trigger, there are no entries found. Maybe a better
or simpler fix would be to have the polling set cqe_seen to true, and
leave the clearing to the interrupt handler as is done now.

That would indeed be much better, and not require is to fiddle with IRQ
less completion queues for more efficient polling. Of the test devices that
I do use, not all of them support coalescing, and of the ones that do, some
of them implement it in a pretty poor fashion.
