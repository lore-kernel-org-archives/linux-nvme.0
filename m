We'd only be TASK_RUNNING if the IRQ got to it first. And that's something that
should be removed as well - I suspect that'd be a much bigger win, getting rid
of the IRQ trigger for polled IO, than most of the micro optimizations. For
Keith's testing, looks like he reduced the cost by turning on coalescing, but
it'd be cheaper (and better) to not have to rely on that.

In any case, the __set_current_state() is very cheap. Given that and the
above, I'd rather keep that.
