That's ideal.

But we'll always see corner case that there is hctx(s) not mapped.
So I want to at least prevent the crash and return an error in the driver.

Here is another example that I create 64 queues on a server with 72 cpus.

hctx index 0: 0, 36
hctx index 1: 1, 37
hctx index 3: 2, 38
hctx index 5: 3, 39
hctx index 7: 4, 40
hctx index 8: 5, 41
hctx index 10: 6, 42
hctx index 12: 7, 43
hctx index 14: 8, 44
hctx index 16: 9, 45
hctx index 17: 10, 46
hctx index 19: 11, 47
hctx index 21: 12, 48
hctx index 23: 13, 49
hctx index 24: 14, 50
hctx index 26: 15, 51
hctx index 28: 16, 52
hctx index 30: 17, 53
hctx index 32: 18, 54
hctx index 33: 19, 55
hctx index 35: 20, 56
hctx index 37: 21, 57
hctx index 39: 22, 58
hctx index 40: 23, 59
hctx index 42: 24, 60
hctx index 44: 25, 61
hctx index 46: 26, 62
hctx index 48: 27, 63
hctx index 49: 28, 64
hctx index 51: 29, 65
hctx index 53  30, 66
hctx index 55:  31, 67
hctx index 56:  32, 68
hctx index 58:  33, 69
hctx index 60:  34, 70
hctx index 62:  35, 71

Other hctxs are not mapped.

Not working for my case with 6 hw queues(8 cpus):

[  108.318247] nvme nvme0: 6 hw queues created, but only 5 were mapped
to sw queues

hctx_idx 0: 0 1 4 5
hctx_idx 1: None
hctx_idx 2: 2
hctx_idx 3: 3
hctx_idx 4: 6
hctx_idx 5: 7
