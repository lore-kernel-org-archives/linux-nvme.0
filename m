Adding physical CPUs to sockets is a very rare activity, and we
should not optimize for it.  Taking CPUs that are physically present
offline and online is the case that is interesting, and that's what
this patchset changes.

Yes.

Do you even see the CPUs in your VM?  For physical hotplug you'll
need to reserve spots in the cpumap beforehand.
