Hi Max,

Generally speaking, blk_mq_freeze_queue() should be fine to drain blk-mq
based request queue, but it may not work well when the hardware is broken.

What is the code you are referring to?

blk_mq_quiesce_queue() only guarantees that no requests can be dispatched to
low level driver, and new requests still can be allocated, but can't be
dispatched until the queue becomes unquiesced.

Generally blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() is used to cancel all in-flight
requests, and it depends on implementation of the busy_tag_iter_fn, and
timed-out request can't be covered by blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter().

So blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() is often used in error recovery path, such
as nvme_dev_disable(), which is usually used in resetting PCIe NVMe controller.

Yes.

As mentioned above, you can't do that by blk_mq_quiesce_queue() &
blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter().

The PCIe NVMe driver takes two steps for the error recovery: nvme_dev_disable() &
nvme_reset_work(), and you may consider the similar approach, but the in-flight
requests won't be drained in this case because they can be requeued.

Could you explain a bit what your exact problem is?

Thanks,
Ming
