Fair enough. This will get documented.

People get real squeamish about just turning on relaxed order for driver/devices we actually know something about and 
test let alone everything. I do agree with your interpretation of the streaming DMA semantics. That does not mean every 
driver writer did or does. :-)

To be clear, this isn't really a host bridge issue. Technically no driver that runs on SPARC needs this enabled -- even 
performance critical ... if they do the HW correctly. Again, we have a necessary performance critical device which does 
not correctly signal its okayness with relaxed order for non-control DMA. This feature of the host bridge is to enable a 
workaround for just these cases (deemed needed by past history). Said differently, lots of devices are made for the 
commodity market where shortcuts like this apparently do not affect performance but are critical to performance on large 
systems.
