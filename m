That's trivially solvable though, since the information is available
at submission time.

There's on way to do it per IO, right. But you can create a sq/cq pair
without interrupts enabled. This would also allow you to scale better
with multiple users of polling, a case where we currently don't
perform as well spdk, for instance.
