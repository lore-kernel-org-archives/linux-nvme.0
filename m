Sounds like the new functions should move to block/10-pi.c given
that they are specific to the T10 defined formats.

Maybe add proper kerneldoc comments given that these are exported
functions?

The 32-byte CDB comment doesn't really make sense here as it is SCSI
specific, so we'll need to drop it or find a good place for it in the
SCSI code.

Maybe call this blk_t10_pi_prepare?

Seems like we could just use the ref_tag variable later instead of
duplicating it.

Looks like we could keep the virt variable inside the loop and assign
it where declared, e.g.:

		u32 virt = bip_get_seed(bip) & 0xffffffff;

at the beginning of this block.

Pi can have local scope here, too.

No need for the empty lines inside this loop.

And pretty much all the  comments apply to this function as well.

scsi_prot_ref_tag could be move to the block layer as it only uses
the sector in the eequest and the sector size, which we can get
from the gendisk as well.  We then don't need to pass it to the function.

We could also move the protection type to the gendisk, although I'm not
sure it's going to be worth it.
