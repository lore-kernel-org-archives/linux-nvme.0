I do see that the NVMe driver is creating a completion interrupt on
each CPU core for the completions. No problems with that. 

However, I don't think you can guarantee that there will always be a single
CPU core targeting one submission queue especially with asynchronous IO.

Lock contention counters from CONFIG_LOCK_STAT are pointing to nvmeq->lock
in my FIO tests.

Did I miss something?

I have also experimented with multiple locks with no significant gains. 
However, I was curious if somebody else had a better implementation than mine.
