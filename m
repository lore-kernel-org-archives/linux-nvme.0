The key point here is we cannot unmap the io requests before we close the controller directly.
The nvme controller may still hold the command after we complete and unmap the io request in nvme_timeout.
This will cause memory corruption.

So we cannot just schedule the eh recovery kthread then return BLK_EH_HANDLED.
We need to deffer the completion of timeout requests until the controller has been closed totally in nvme_dev_disable.
