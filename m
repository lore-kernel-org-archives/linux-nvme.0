I understand your frustration. It is annoying not having easy access to 
hardware. As you properly are aware, similarly with host-managed SMR 
drives, there are customers that use your drives, while not being 
available off-the-shelf.

All of the open-channel SSD work is done in the open. Patches, new 
targets, and so forth are being developed for everyone to see. 
Similarly, the NVMe host interface is developed in the open as well. The 
interface allows one to implements supporting firmware. The "front-end" 
of the FTL on the SSD, is removed, and the "back-end" engine is exposed. 
It is not much work and given HGST already have an SSD firmware 
implementation. I bet you guys can whip up an internal implementation in 
a matter of weeks. If you choose to do so, I will bend over backwards to 
help you sort out any quirks that might be.

Another option is to use the qemu extension. We are improving it 
continuously to make sure it follows the implementation of a real 
hardware OCSSDs. Today we do 90% of our FTL work using qemu, and most of 
the time it just works when we run the FTL code on real hardware.

Similarly to vendors that provide new CPUs, NVDIMMs, and graphic 
drivers. Some code and refactoring go in years in advance. What I am 
proposing here is to discuss how OCSSDs fits into the storage stack, and 
what we can do to improve it. Optimally, most of the lightnvm subsystem 
can be removed by exposing vectored I/Os. Which then enables 
implementation of a target to be a traditional device mapper module. 
That would be great!
