It pains me that you're marching us towards increased conflict that
needs resolution through more formal means.  And that now I'm going to
have to document the timeline of your authoritarian approach to
stifling another Linux maintainer's freedom to do his job of delivering
on functionality I've been depended on for many years.

I've only ever posted patches in the open and never has it been with the
idea of sneaking anything in.  Miscategorizing my actions as such is a
gross abuse that I will not tolerate.

If we were to confine ourselves to this v2 patch I pleaded with you to
take: https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/11/17/4

1) Hannes proposed a simplistic patch that didn't account for the fact
   that NVMe's ana workqueue wouldn't get kicked, his intent was to make
   ANA work independent of your native multipathing.  (The fact he or I
   even need to post such patches, to unwind your tight-coupling of ANA
   and multipathing, speaks to how you've calculatingly undermined any
   effort to implement proper NVMe multipathing outside of the NVMe
   driver)

2) ANA and multipathing are completely disjoint on an NVMe spec level.
   You know this.

SO: will you be taking my v2 patch for 4.21 or not?

Please advise, thanks.
Mike
