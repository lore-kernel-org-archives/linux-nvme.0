For avoiding use-after-free, one request can only be completed by
one path, either by timeout path or normal completion(irq or cancel)
from driver.

So before handling this req's timeout, this request has to be
marked as completed by blk-mq timeout code already, then nvme_cancel_request()
can't cover this timed-out request.

Thanks,
