Your 0th header speaks to the NVMe multipath IO path leveraging NVMe's
lack of partial completion but I think it'd be useful to have this
header (that actually gets committed) speak to it.

Also, the block core patch to introduce blk_steal_bios() already went in
but should there be a QUEUE_FLAG that gets set by drivers like NVMe that
don't support partial completion?

This would make it easier for other future drivers to know whether they
can use a more optimized IO path.
