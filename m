Hello, Ming.

Sorry about the delay.

That doesn't make sense to me.  How is synchronize_rcu() gonna change
anything there?

Is it just waiting till confirm_kill is called?  So that new ref is
not given away?  If synchronization like that is gonna work, the
percpu ref operations on the reader side must be wrapped in a larger
critical region, which brings up two issues.

1. Callers of percpu_ref must not depend on what internal
   synchronization construct percpu_ref uses.  Again, percpu_ref
   doesn't even use regular RCU.

2. If there is already an outer RCU protection around ref operation,
   that RCU critical section can and should be used for
   synchronization, not percpu_ref.

It sounds like this was more of an abuse.  So, basically what you want
is sth like the following.

READER

 rcu_read_lock();
 if (can_issue_new_commands)
	issue;
 else
	abort;
 rcu_read_unlock();

WRITER

 can_issue_new_commands = false;
 synchronize_rcu();
 // no new command will be issued anymore

Right?  There isn't much wheel to reinvent here and using percpu_ref
for the above is likely already incorrect due to the different RCU
type being used.

That likely bool test isn't gonna cost anything.

And the synchronization part should always be considered and is
already likely wrong.

Thanks.
