I might be stating the obvious, but so far we only have considered 
request-based multipath as being active for the _entire_ device.
To my knowledge we've never tested that when running on a partition.

So, have you tested that request-based multipathing works on a partition 
_at all_? I'm not sure if partition mapping is done correctly here; we 
never remap the start of the request (nor bio, come to speak of it), so 
it looks as if we would be doing the wrong things here.

Have you checked that partition remapping is done correctly?

Cheers,
