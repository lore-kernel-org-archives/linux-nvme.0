Think of some current advanced features of DM-Multipath combined with multipath-tools
such as path-latency priority grouping, intermittent IO error accounting for path
degradation, delayed or immediate or follow-over failback feature.
Those features, which is significant in some scenario, need to use per-controller block devices.
Therefore, I think it is worthy adding a CONFIG_NVME_MULTIPATHING knob to
hide or show per-controller block devices.

How about let me to add this this CONFIG_NVME_MULTIPATHING knob?

Guan
