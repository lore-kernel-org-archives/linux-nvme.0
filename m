Sorry, the above was a bit terse. I think a much better solution would
be to create a number of buckets (per data direction) and do stats on
all of them. The buckets would cover a reasonable range of request
sizes. Then when you poll for a given request, we can base our timed
number on the data direction AND size of it. You can get pretty far with
a few buckets:

512b
4k
8k
16k
32k
64k
128k

and you could even have your time estimation function turn these into
something sane. Or just use a composite of buckets, if you wish.
