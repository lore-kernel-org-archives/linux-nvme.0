Maybe reorder this so the "size" (total amount) is documented before
"available" (some subset of "size")?

It doesn't read quite right to talk about "use within the driver that
*published* it".  Is it really published in that case?  That sounds more
like "private".  I expected something like the following (but I don't claim
to understand the whole use model here):

  ... this file contains a '1' if the memory has been published for use
  outside the driver that owns the device.
