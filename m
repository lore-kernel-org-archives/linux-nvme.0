since the timeout value can be adjusted via module parameter, and any
schedule delay can be introduced in one busy system.

It isn't a good practice to rely on timing for avoiding race, IMO.

OK, please fix other issues mentioned in the following comment together,
then I will review further and see if it can work well.
