Any chance you can make the organization like what I did with FC and 
avoid all the "new" and "remove" flags ?

e.g. code blocks for:
- allocation/initialization for the controller and the tag sets. 
Basically initial allocation/creation of everything that would be the 
os-facing side of the controller.
- an association (or call it a session) create. Basically everything 
that makes the link-side ties to the subsystem and creates the 
controller and its connections. Does admin queue creation, controller 
init, and io queue creation, and enablement of the blk-mq queues as it 
does so.
- an association teardown. Basically everything that stops the blk-mq 
queues and tears down the link-side ties to the controller.
- a final controller teardown, which removes it from the system. 
Everything that terminates the os-facing side of the controller.
