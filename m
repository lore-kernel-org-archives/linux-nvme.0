Looks like we cannot switch a percpu-ref to percpu mode directly w/o drain it.
Some references maybe lost.

static void __percpu_ref_switch_to_percpu(struct percpu_ref *ref)
{
	unsigned long __percpu *percpu_count = percpu_count_ptr(ref);
	int cpu;

	BUG_ON(!percpu_count);

	if (!(ref->percpu_count_ptr & __PERCPU_REF_ATOMIC))
		return;

	atomic_long_add(PERCPU_COUNT_BIAS, &ref->count);

	/*
	 * Restore per-cpu operation.  smp_store_release() is paired
	 * with READ_ONCE() in __ref_is_percpu() and guarantees that the
	 * zeroing is visible to all percpu accesses which can see the
	 * following __PERCPU_REF_ATOMIC clearing.
	 */
	for_each_possible_cpu(cpu)
		*per_cpu_ptr(percpu_count, cpu) = 0;

	smp_store_release(&ref->percpu_count_ptr,
			  ref->percpu_count_ptr & ~__PERCPU_REF_ATOMIC);
}

In normal case, it is just a judgment like 

	if (unlikely(READ_ONCE(q->queue_gate))

It should not be a big deal.
