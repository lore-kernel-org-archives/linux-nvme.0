Not sure if stealing bios from requests is a better design. Note that
we do exactly this in other transport (nvme_[rdma|loop|fc]_is_ready).

I think it would be better to stick to a coherent behavior across
the nvme subsystem. If this condition statement is really something
that is buying us measurable performance gain, I think we should apply
it for other transports as well (although in fabrics we're a bit
different because we have a dedicated connect that enters .queue_rq)
