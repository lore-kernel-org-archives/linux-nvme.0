Yes, this would create some trouble for our simple policy for divvying
queue resources. We wouldn't be able to use the PCI IRQ affinity for
these queues CPU map, for example.

Maybe if we can figure out a good policy for WRR queues, that might
present a similar infrastructure for supporting polled queues as well.
