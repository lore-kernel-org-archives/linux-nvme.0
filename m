I think you're right.

We now quiesce the queue and fast fail inflight io, in
nvme_complete_rq we call blk_mq_requeue_request with
!blk_mq_queue_stopped(req->q) which is now true.

So the requeue_work is triggered and requeue the request,
and when we unquiesce we simply run the hw queues again.

If we were to call it with !blk_queue_quiesced(req->q)
I think it would be needed though...
