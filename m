On GPU ATS is always tie to a PASID. You do not do the former without
the latter (AFAICT this is not doable, maybe through some JTAG but not
in normal operation).

GPU are like CPU, so you have GPU threads that run against an address
space. This address space use a page table (very much like the CPU page
table). Now inside that page table you can point GPU virtual address
to use GPU memory or use system memory. Those system memory entry can
also be mark as ATS against a given PASID.

On some GPU you define a window of GPU virtual address that goes through
PASID & ATS (so access in that window do not go through the page table
but directly through PASID & ATS).
