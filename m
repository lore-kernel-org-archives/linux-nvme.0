No.  nvme_failover_req() is only ever called by native multipathing; see
nvme_complete_rq()'s check for req->cmd_flags & REQ_NVME_MPATH as the
condition for calling nvme_complete_rq().

The previos RFC-style patch I posted muddled ANA and multipathing in
nvme_update_ana() but this final patch submission was fixed because I
saw a cleaner way forward by having nvme_failover_req() also do ANA work
just like it always has -- albeit with new helpers that
nvme_update_ana() also calls.
