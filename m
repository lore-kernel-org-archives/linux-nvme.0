The nvme-loop part looks fine, but why is the nvme-fc part using:

enum nvme_fc_queue_flags {                                                     
        NVME_FC_Q_CONNECTED = (1 << 0),                                         
+       NVME_FC_Q_LIVE = (1 << 1),                                              
}; 

for flags that are used with set_bit() and friends? That's just
misleading, should be 0, 1, etc, not a shift.

The rest looks pretty straight forward, but the above is an eye sore.
