Yes, it would simplify things. However, as best as I can tell, when we 
allocate memory we don't know what namespace it will be used for. If 
there is a way, I could probably rework it so there's a P2P device per 
namespace.

Can you show me how we'd know the namespace to use in 
nvmet_rdma_map_sgl_keyed()?

Thanks,

Logan
