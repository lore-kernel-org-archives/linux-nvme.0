Yes, but it's a bit different to expect that someone calling 
pci_p2pmem_map_sg() will know what they're doing and provide a 
homogenous SG. It is relatively clear by convention that the entire SG 
must be homogenous given they're calling a pci_p2pmem function. Where 
as, allowing P2P SGs into the core DMA code means all we can do is hope 
that future developers don't screw it up and allow P2P pages to mix in 
with regular pages.

It's also very difficult to add similar functionality to dma_map_page 
seeing dma_unmap_page won't have any way to know what it's dealing with. 
It just seems confusing to support P2P in the SG version and not the 
page version.

Yes, this is almost identical to the earlier patch I referenced...

Yes, I agree this would be very nice. But it's challenging at this time 
to do it safely. And something like this can still be done in future 
work after this patch set gets merged. The changes in this set to the 
RDMA and block layers are fairly small and the majority of the block 
layer changes would still be required anyway to ensure a given 
queue/driver supports P2P requests.

I don't agree that this is a fundamental requirement. But if no one else 
objects to adding unused arguments I'd be fine with adding them.
