There are other devices that follow the same programming pattern
(device_add_disk followed by sysfs_create_group), but I haven't tested
them all, nor reviewed whether these devices need the disk's sysfs
attributes for udev processing. If they don't, the problem will just go
unnoticed.

SCSI obviously takes a very different approach to sysfs layout.

Well, it would make sense to separate the block (disk) device from the
device representing the NVMe subsys/namespace in sysfs. But I guess
it's too late for that now. Actually, the first attempt I made to solve
this problem was exactly that, and it proved to "work", too, but only
at the cost of changing the path of the NVMe block device in sysfs,
which I considered a no-go. Thus I came up with the approach I posted.

Martin
