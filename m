This change looks incomplete to me. I think the following scenario is 
not handled properly by the above patch:
- host->hostt->eh_timed_out() gets called.
- The request "req" completes from another context while
   host->hostt->eh_timed_out() is in progress.
- host->hostt->eh_timed_out() calls scsi_finish_command().

I think that scenario will lead to a double completion.

Bart.
