One of the ways this could be done in the ZBC specification (assuming
that erase blocks == zones) would be set the "reset" bit in the zone
descriptor which is returned by the REPORT ZONES EXT command.  This is
a hint that the a reset write pointer should be sent to the zone in
question, and it could be set when you start seeing soft ECC errors or
the flash management layer has decided that the zone should be
rewritten in the near future.  A simple way to do this is to ask the
Host OS to copy the data to another zone and then send a reset write
pointer command for the zone.

So I think it very much could be done, and done within the framework
of the ZBC model --- although whether SSD manufactuers will chose to
do this, and/or choose to engage the T10/T13 standards committees to
add the necessary extensions to the ZBC specification is a question
that we probably can't answer in this venue or by the participants on
this thread.

So I can imagine a setup where the flash translation layer manages the
mapping between zone numbers and the physical erase blocks, such that
when the host OS issues an "reset write pointer", it immediately gets
a new erase block assigned to the specific zone in question.  The
original erase block would then get erased in the background, when the
flash chip in question is available for maintenance activities.

I think you've been thinking about a model where *either* the host as
complete control over all aspects of the flash management, or the FTL
has complete control --- and it may be that there are more clever ways
that the work could be split between flash device and the host OS.

This is why I suspect that exposing the full details of the details of
the Flash layout via LUNS is a bad, bad, BAD idea.  It's much better
to use an abstraction such as Zones, and then have an abstraction
layer that hides the low-level details of the hardware from the OS.
The trick is picking an abstraction that exposes the _right_ set of
details so that the division of labor betewen the Host OS and the
storage device is at a better place.  Hence my suggestion of perhaps
providing a virtual mapping layer betewen "Zone number" and the
low-level physical erase block.

Yes, this is why using LUN's are a BAD idea.  There's too much code
--- in file systems, in the block layer in terms of how we expose
block devices, etc., that assumes that different LUN's are used for
different logical containers of storage.  There has been decades of
usage of this concept by enterprise storage arrays.  Trying to
appropriate LUN's for another use case is stupid.  And maybe we can't
stop OCSSD folks if they have gone down that questionable design path,
but there's nothing that says we have to expose it as a SCSI LUN
inside of Linux!

If you have virtual mapping layer between zones and erase blocks, a
reset write pointer could be fast for SSD's as well.  And that allows
the implementation of your suggestion below:
