Subject: [PATCH V4 0/7] nvme: pci: fix & improve timeout handling
Message-ID: <20180505135905.18815-1-ming.lei@redhat.com>

Hi,

The 1st patch introduces blk_quiesce_timeout() and blk_unquiesce_timeout()
for NVMe, meantime fixes blk_sync_queue().

The 2nd patch covers timeout for admin commands for recovering controller
for avoiding possible deadlock.

The 3rd and 4th patches avoid to wait_freeze on queues which aren't frozen.

The last 4 patches fixes several races wrt. NVMe timeout handler, and
finally can make blktests block/011 passed. Meantime the NVMe PCI timeout
mecanism become much more rebost than before.

gitweb:
	https://github.com/ming1/linux/commits/v4.17-rc-nvme-timeout.V4

V4:
	- fixe nvme_init_set_host_mem_cmd()
	- use nested EH model, and run both nvme_dev_disable() and
	resetting in one same context

V3:
	- fix one new race related freezing in patch 4, nvme_reset_work()
	may hang forever without this patch
	- rewrite the last 3 patches, and avoid to break nvme_reset_ctrl*()

V2:
	- fix draining timeout work, so no need to change return value from
	.timeout()
	- fix race between nvme_start_freeze() and nvme_unfreeze()
	- cover timeout for admin commands running in EH

Ming Lei (7):
