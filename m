Sounds like landmines here since the reader probably can't translate
"code that isn't prepared for it" into a list of interfaces that are
off-limits.  But that's a VM issue that is above my pay grade, so I'm
not suggesting any change; just pointing out something that makes me
wonder "hmmm..., how would I act on this?"
