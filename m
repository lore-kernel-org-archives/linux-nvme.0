I have a P3700 but somehow burned the FW. Let me see if I can bring it back to
live. 

I also have converted AHCI to the irq_poll interface and will run some tests.
I do also have some hpsa devices on which I could run tests once the driver is
adopted.

But can we come to a common testing methology not to compare apples with
oranges? Sagi do you still have the fio job file from your last tests laying
somewhere and if yes could you share it?

Byte,
