Btw, one thing we should do in blk-mq and scsi is to make the time
optional.  If the blk_mq driver doesn't even have a timeout structure
there is no point in timing out requests and enter the timeout handler
ever.  Same for those scsi drivers always returning BLK_EH_RESET_TIMER.

Whether never having timeouts is a good idea is a different discussion,
but as long as we have such drivers we should handle them somewhat sane.

This looks pretty sensible to me as a band-aid.  It just needs a very
detailed comment explaining what is going on here.
