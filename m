I spent some time this morning reading through the numerous specs/documents,
with a lot of coffee.

Specifically in:
https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_SWG_SIIS_Version_1_02_Revision_1_00_20111230.pdf

5.5.2
Namespace

A target that has multiple Namespaces MAY have  multiple TPers. Each TPer
SHALL be associated with a different Namespace. Every Namespace on a device
is not required to have a TPer, but Namespaces that support the TCG Core
specification commands and functionality SHALL have a TPer. A TPer SHALL only
be associated with exactly one Namespace. A Namespace MAY have no TPer.

>From reading that it seems we will probably have to keep it at the block layer,
since its possible to have a valid "Locking range 1" on n1 and a "Locking range 1"
on n2.
