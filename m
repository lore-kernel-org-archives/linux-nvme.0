Exactly. So taking a position to not support NPO2 I think seems counter
productive to the future of ZNS, the question whould be, *how* to best
do this in light of what we need to support / avoid performance
regressions / strive towards avoiding fragmentation.

I'm not, but I admit that it's a good point of having the possibility of
zones being taken offline also implicates holes. I also think it was a
good excercise to discuss and evaluate emulation given I don't think
this point you made would have been made clear otherwise. This is why
I treat ZNS as evolving effort, and I can't seriously take any position
stating all answers are known.

NAND does not incur a PO2 requirement, that should be enough to
implicate that PO2 zones *can* be expected. If no vendor wants
to take a position that they know for a fact they'll never adopt
PO2 zones should be enough to keep an open mind to consider *how*
to support them.

I'm not quite sure that is the case. To reach consensus one has
to take a position of accepting the right answer may not be known
and we evaluate all prospects. It is not clear to me that we've done
that yet and it is why I think a venue such as LSFMM may be good to
review these things.

Sorry I didn't understand the suggestion here, can you clarify what it
is you are suggesting?

Thanks!
