Even prior to the RESETING state, every single command, no matter
which namespace or request_queue it came on, is reclaimed by the driver.
There *should* be no requests to timeout after nvme_dev_disable is called
because the nvme driver returned control of all requests in the tagset
to blk-mq.

In any case, if blk-mq decides it won't complete those requests, we
can just swap the order in the reset_work: sync first, uncondintionally
disable. Does the following snippet look more okay?
