Okay, forget about nvme for a moment here. Please run this thought
experiment to decide if what you're saying is even plausible for any
block driver with the existing implementation:

Your scenario has a driver return EH_HANDLED for a timed out request. The
timeout work then completes the request. The request may then be
reallocated for a new command and dispatched.

At approximately the same time, you're saying the driver that returned
EH_HANDLED may then call blk_mq_complete_request() in reference to the
*old* request that it returned EH_HANDLED for, incorrectly completing
the new request before it is done. That will inevitably lead to data
corruption. Is that happening today in any driver?
