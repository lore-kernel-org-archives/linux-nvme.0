I definitely think it's worth revisiting that for the longer term.

For near term, I don't want scsi error handling broken for 4.18, but also
not revert the changes that fixed all the other drivers. Restoring the
old behavior that scsi wants isolated to the scsi driver seems like the
lowest touch option.

My patch restores the state that scsi had in 4.17. It still has that
gap that may lose requests forever when the scsi LLD always returns
BLK_EH_RESET_TIMER (see virtio-scsi, for example). That gap existed prior,
so that's not new with my patch. Maybe we can fix that with a slight
modification to my previous patch. It looks like SCSI really wants to
block completions only when it hands off the command to the error handler,
so we don't need to have the inflight -> compete -> inflight transition,
and the following is all that's needed:
