This took longer to narrow than I hoped. I had been getting very wild
results, and there were two things to blame: a kernel irq issue[*],
and a platform bios causing a lot of CPU thermal frequency throttling.

Now that's sorted out, I am back to tuning this and the opprotunistic
nvme submission side polling once again does not produce a measurable
difference. My world is sane again. Will try to send an update for
consideration this week after some more testing.
