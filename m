Of the two you mentioned, yours is preferable IMO. While I appreciate
Jianchao's detailed analysis, it's hard to take a proposal seriously
that so colourfully calls everyone else "dangerous" while advocating
for silently losing requests on purpose.

But where's the option that fixes scsi to handle hardware completions
concurrently with arbitrary timeout software? Propping up that house of
cards can't be the only recourse.
