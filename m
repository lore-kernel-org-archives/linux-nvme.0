That may run nvme_pre_reset_dev() two times from both EH thread and
reset_work, looks not good.

IMO the model is not complicated(one EH thread with two-stage resetting), and
it may be cloned to rdma, fc, .. without much difficulty.

Follows the model:

1) single EH thread, in which controller should be guaranteed to
shutdown, and EH thread is waken up when controller needs to be
recovered.

2) 1st stage resetting: recover controller, which has to run in one
work context, since admin commands for recover may timeout.

3) 2nd stage resetting: draining IO & updating controller state to live,
which has to run in another context, since IOs during this stage may
timeout too.

The reset lock is used to sync between 1st stage resetting and 2nd
stage resetting. The '1st stage resetting' is scheduled from EH thread,
and the '2nd state resetting' is scheduled after the '1st stage
resetting' is done.

The implementation might not be so complicated too, since V3 has partitioned
reset_work into two parts, then what we just need to do in V4 is to
run each in one work from EH thread.

I'd suggest to not change controller state as DELETING in this case,
otherwise it may be reported as another bug, in which controller becomes
completely unusable. This issue can be easily triggered by blktests
block/011, in this test case, controller is always recoverable.

I will post out V4, and see if all current issues can be covered, and
how complicated the implementation is.

Thanks
