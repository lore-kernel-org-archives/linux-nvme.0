That is an interesting question: We actually have the
"DMA_ATTR_NO_KERNEL_MAPPING" for this case, and ARM implements
it in the coherent interface, so that might be a good fit.

Implementing it in the streaming API makes no sense since we
already have a kernel mapping here, but using a normal allocation
(possibly with DMA_ATTR_NON_CONSISTENT or DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC,
need to check) might help on other architectures that have
limited amounts of coherent memory and no CMA.

Another benefit of the coherent API for this kind of buffer is
that we can use CMA where available to get a large consecutive
chunk of RAM on architectures without an IOMMU when normal
memory is no longer available because of fragmentation.
