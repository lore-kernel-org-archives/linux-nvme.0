Nobody else seems keen on allowing the user to enable this on hardware that doesn't work. The easiest solution is still limiting it to using a switch. From there, if someone wants to start creating a white-list then that's probably the way forward to support root ports.

I thought only few root ports had problem. Thanks for clarifying that.

Do you think you can keep a pointer to the parent bridge instead of querying it
via get_upstream_bridge_port() here so that we can reuse your
pci_p2pdma_disable_acs() in the future.

+int pci_p2pdma_disable_acs(struct pci_dev *pdev)
+{
+	struct pci_dev *up;
+	int pos;
+	u16 ctrl;
+
+	up = get_upstream_bridge_port(pdev);
+	if (!up)
+		return 0;

Some future device would only deal with pci_p2pdma_add_client(() for whitelisting
instead of changing all of your code.

We should at least limit the usage of get_upstream_bridge_port() family of functions
to probe time only.

We can tell iommu to do one to one translation by passing iommu.passthrough=1 to kernel
command line to have identical behavior to your switch case.
