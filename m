Oops, that must have been from a bad rebase.... Will Fix.

Ok.

I'd rather keep the logic for whether to enable p2pmem in it's own
function. nvme_alloc_ctrl() is already very long and complicated.

Because you never answered my question back in March[1] (which I think
you've answered below)....

I did not realize the namespace would be available at this time. I guess
I can give this a try, but it's going to be a fairly big change from
what's presented here... Though, I agree it'll probably be an improvement.
