The reference only covers request's lifetime, not related with completion.

It isn't the last reference. When driver returns EH_HANDLED, blk-mq
will complete this request on extra time.

Yes, if driver's timeout code and normal completion code can sync
about this completion, that should be fine, but the current behaviour
doesn't depend driver's sync since the req is always completed atomically
via the following way:

1) timeout

if (mark_completed(rq))
   timed_out(rq)

2) normal completion
if (mark_completed(rq))
    complete(rq)

For example, before nvme_timeout() is trying to run nvme_dev_disable(),
irq comes and this req is completed from normal completion path, but
nvme_timeout() still returns EH_HANDLED, and blk-mq may complete
the req one extra time since the normal completion path may not update
req's state yet.
