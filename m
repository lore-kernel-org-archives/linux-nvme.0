The first part I could see, but I still want to make it conditional
in some way as nvme is going into deeply embedded setups, and I don't
want to carry the weight of the ANA code around for everyone.

The second I fundamentally disagree with.  And even if you found agreement
it would have to be in a separate patch as it is a separate feature.
