Not arguing with you at all, you obviously gave it a lot of thought.

I thought your multipathing code would really live in the block
layer and only require something really basic from nvme (which could
easily be applied on other drivers). But I do understand it might
create a lot of churn.

btw, why are partial completions something that can't be done
without cloning the bio? is it possible to clone the bio once from the
completion flow when you see that you got a partial completion?
