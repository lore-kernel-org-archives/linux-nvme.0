I suggest you to double check if the controller is set as DEAD
in nvme_remove() since there won't be any log dumped when this happen.

If controller is set as DEAD and queues are killed, and all IO should
have been dispatched to driver and nvme_queueu_rq() will fail them all,
then there isn't any reason to see the hang in your stack trace log.

I will try this test, and hope I can reproduce it in my environment.
