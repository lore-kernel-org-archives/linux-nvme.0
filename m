The 4.12 sounds interesting. I remember Mel ran some test with 4.12 as
we where considering to flip the config option for SLES and it showed
several road blocks.

I'm not sure whether he re-evaluated 4.13/4.14 on his grid though.

But I'm definitively interested in this discussion and can even possibly
share some benchmark results we did in our FC Lab.
