That is a good question.

Today I investigate further, and figured out that it is because that
blk_mq_start_stopped_hw_queues() in nvme_kill_queues() does not
run hw queues actually becasue the queues are started in
nvme_reset_work() already. Will figure out a patch later to fix the
issue.

And the reason why this patch 'fixes' the issue is that just timing,
I guess.

Now I am not a big fun of this patch for fixing the issue.

But I still think it may be better to move nvme_kill_queues() into
nvme_remove_dead_ctrl() as an improvement because during this small
window page cache can be used up by write application, and no writeback
can move on meantime.

Thanks,
