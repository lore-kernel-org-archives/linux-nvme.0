We tried things like this in an earlier iteration[1] which assumed the 
SG was homogenous (all P2P or all regular memory). This required serious 
ugliness to try and ensure SGs were in fact homogenous[2]. If you don't 
assume homogenousness you need change every DMA mapping provider or have 
a way to efficiently know if the SGL contains any P2P pages.

Unfortunately, it's hard to do any of this without significant 
improvements to the SGL code (like [3]) but I understand there's 
significant push back against such changes at this time.

Creating new direction flags doesn't really solve the problem you point 
out. It'd only really work in the rdma_rw_ctx_init() case because that 
function already takes the direction argument. It doesn't work in the 
similar block device case because the DMA direction isn't passed through 
the request.

Though, if there's agreement to do something like that I'm not against it.

Generally, the feedback that I get is to not make changes that try to 
anticipate the future. It would be easy enough to add those arguments 
when the code for going through the RC is made (which I expect will be 
very involved anyway).
