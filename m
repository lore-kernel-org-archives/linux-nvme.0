I mean the EH kthread and the reset_work which both could reset the ctrl instead of
the pre and post rest context.

Honestly, I suspect a bit that whether it is worthy to try to recover from [1].
The Eh kthread solution could make things easier, but the codes for recovery from [1] has
made code really complicated. It is more difficult to unify the nvme-pci, rdma and fc. 

How about just fail the resetting as the Keith's solution ?

[1] io timeout when nvme_reset_work or the new nvme_post_reset_dev invoke nvme_wait_freeze.

Thanks
