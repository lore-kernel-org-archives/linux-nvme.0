Lets worry about reuse NVMe when it is actually applicable.

By detailed performance results I meant:
1. Full latency histogram for QD=1 both for single queue and multi-queue
(including max, 99.99% and 99.999% percentiles)
2. latency vs. IOPs graph/table for both single queue and multi-queue
3. At least some measurement/analysis of how well the algorithm is
    adapting to workload change dynamically and how quickly.
4. Test also with real NVMe devices.

Also, we need to separate the host side moderation and the target
side moderation to understand if/how they effect each other.

Its very easy to show that for high stress workloads you can get an
improvement as obviously there is a clear win for interrupt moderation,
however, if this was the only metric that is interesting, we wouldn't
need it to be adaptive.

As I said before, this adds entropy to the equation which in certain use
cases can make more harm than good, and we need to quantify where is the
impact and understand how important they are compared to the extremely
niche use-case of a single host pushing 2M-8M IOPs.

I've seen this before, why are we not getting 100Gb/s for 4k with CX5?
I recall we used to get it with CX4.

The fact that the 64k 99% latency is substantially higher (20+
milliseconds) without any BW benefit, while its not a very interesting
measurement, gives me an indication that a more detailed analysis needs
to be made here to understand where are the trade-offs.

I was suggesting a sysctl global parameter for global behavior and of
someone wants to override it it can add a CQ flag (which follows the
common net params exactly).
