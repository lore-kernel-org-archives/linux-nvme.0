nvme_dev_disable tears down irq's, meaing their handling is already
sync'ed before nvme_dev_disable can proceed. Whether the completion
comes through nvme_irq, or through nvme_dev_disable, there is no way
possible for nvme's timeout to return EH_HANDLED if the state was not
updated prior to returning that status.
