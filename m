Even some scsi drivers are susceptible to losing their requests with the
reverted behavior: take virtio-scsi for example, which returns RESET_TIMER
from it's timeout handler. With the behavior everyone seems to want,
a natural completion at or around the same time is lost forever because
it was blocked from completion with no way to recover.

While the timing for when requests may be lost is quite narrow, I've
seen it enough with very difficult to reproduce scenarios that hardware
devs no longer trust IO timeouts are their problem because Linux loses
their completions.
