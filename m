The presence of ahci bar remapping is documented here:

http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/chipsets/100-series-chipset-datasheet-vol-2.html

The PCI memory space is remapped, the configuration space of the
remapped device is not available, and interrupts are shared.

This is a capability of the "Intel? 100 Series Chipset Family".  These
patches matter because this chipset in this configuration appears in
laptops that you can buy today and Linux is unable to access the NVMe
device.

Linux users are unable to access storage without these patches.

Talking with Keith, subsystem-resets are a feature of enterprise-class
NVMe devices.  I think those features are out of scope for the class
of devices that will find themselves in a platform with this
configuration, same for hot-plug.

Whatever answer we, in the Linux kernel community, come up with,
leaving storage inaccessible is not an acceptable answer.
