Hi Keith,

I like this series a lot.  One comment that is probably close
to the big discussion in the thread:

>  	switch (ret) {
>  	case BLK_EH_HANDLED:
>  		/*

The state check here really irked me, and from the thread it seems like
I'm not the only one.  At least for the NVMe case I think it is perfectly
safe, although I agree I'd rather audit what other drivers do carefully.

That being said I think BLK_EH_HANDLED seems like a fundamentally broken
idea, and I'd actually prefer to get rid of it over adding things like
the MQ_RQ_IN_FLIGHT check above.

E.g. if we look at the cases where nvme-pci returns it:

 - if we did call nvme_dev_disable, we already canceled all requests,
   so we might as well just return BLK_EH_NOT_HANDLED
 - the poll for completion case already completed the command,
   so we should return BLK_EH_NOT_HANDLED

So I think we need to fix up nvme and if needed any other driver
to return the right value and then assert that the request is
still in in-flight status for the BLK_EH_HANDLED case.

I think this helper can go away now.  But we should have a comment
near the state field documenting the concurrency implications.

This should probably be a mq_rq_state instead.  Which means it needs
to be moved to blkdev.h, but that should be ok.
