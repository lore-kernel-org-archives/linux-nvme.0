Subject: [PATCH 1/6] irq/affinity: Assign all online CPUs to vectors
In-Reply-To: <1483569671-1462-1-git-send-email-keith.busch@intel.com>
References: <1483569671-1462-1-git-send-email-keith.busch@intel.com>
Message-ID: <1483569671-1462-2-git-send-email-keith.busch@intel.com>

This patch makes sure all online CPUs are assigned to vectors in
cases where the nodes don't have the same number of online CPUs.
The calculation for how many vectors needs to be assigned should account
for the number of CPUs for a particular node on each round of assignment
in order to ensure all online CPUs are assigned a vector when they don't
evenly divide, and calculate extras accordingly.

Since we attempt to divide evently among the nodes, this may still result
in unused vectors if some nodes have fewer CPUs than nodes previosuly
set up, but at least every online CPU will be assigned to something.
