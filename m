No, locality matters. If you have a bunch of NICs and bunch of drives
and the allocator chooses to put all P2P memory on a single drive your
performance will suck horribly even if all the traffic is offloaded.

Performance will suck if you have speed differences between the PCI-E
devices. Eg a bunch of Gen 3 x8 NVMe cards paired with a Gen 4 x16 NIC
will not reach full performance unless the p2p buffers are properly
balanced between all cards.

This is why I think putting things in one big pool and pretending like
any P2P mem is interchangable with any other makes zero sense to me,
it is not how the system actually works. Proper locality matters a
lot.
