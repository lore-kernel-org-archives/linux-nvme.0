Hi Jens,

Our test teams ran stress tests on several machines over the last week
on a test kernel with your patches applied, and were no longer able to
reproduce the issue.

Thanks a lot for helping out on this one.

Right, I got your point.  Your patch definitely prevents the WARN_ON
from occurring on CPU hotplug events too.  So thanks a lot for help on
that too :)
