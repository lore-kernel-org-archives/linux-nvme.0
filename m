I'm pretty surre Hannes will appreciate being called an evil genius :)

I thought about adding it, but mostly for a different reason: it's
quite a bit of code, and we now start to see NVMe in deeply embedded
contexts, e.g. the latest Compact Flash spec is based on NVMe, so it
might be a good idea to give people a chance to avoid the overhead.

I don't think you'll get very useful results, even if you try.  But I
guess we'll just have to tell people to use SuSE if they want NVMe
multipathing to work then :)
