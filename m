Subject: [PATCH 2/2] nvme-rdma: Add TOS for rdma transport
In-Reply-To: <1564912530-15404-1-git-send-email-israelr@mellanox.com>
References: <1564912530-15404-1-git-send-email-israelr@mellanox.com>
Message-ID: <1564912530-15404-2-git-send-email-israelr@mellanox.com>

For RDMA transports, TOS is an extension of IB QoS to provide clients
the ability to segregate traffic flows for different type of data.
RDMA CM abstract it for ULPs using rdma_set_service_type().
Internally, each traffic flow is represented by a connection with all of
its independent resources like that of a normal connection, and is
differentiated by service type. In other words, there can be multiple qp
connections between an IP pair and each supports a unique service type.

Note: In addition QOS must be configured on the relevant HCA on the
target (send RDMA commands) and initiator to effect the traffic.
