That's where we started off from :)

But we got to a point where it started getting convoluted for generic
nvme optional features which are mandatory for fabrics (like keep-alive
support) that are detected in different forms (controller identify and
fabric admin connect). Anyway we thought it'd be cleaner to have it
directly in nvme_ctrl and centralize their assignments in a single
location.
