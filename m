Well. that's simply not acceptable.  We will need a theory of
operation for this device to support it, because the patch as-is
simply doesn't make sense.

We'll also need to know where such device might show up, and why
Linux support for it matters.

Yikes.  I'm really tempted to say this is not acceptable - Intel
really must know better.

It's not about how often reset are needed (and there are controller
resets in addition to function level resets), but how they are
defined to work.  What state is a controller in after a host initiated
reset, after a PCIe hotplug or even warm plug.  What state is the
PCI device in when the controller is in a failed state?

I think the simple answer is to not support this device.  It's not like
Intel doesn't know the AHCI and NVMe specs and had any reaoson to come
up with a piece of junk like this.
