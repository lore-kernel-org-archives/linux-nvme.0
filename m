Hi Keith,

Thanks for looking at this issue!

The thing is that remove can happen any time, either from hotplug or
unbinding driver or 'echo 1 > $PCI_PATH/remove'. At the same time,
the reset can be ongoing.

Also looks the hang in del_gendisk() is fixed by this change, but I
just found a new issue which is triggered after the NVMe PCI device is rescaned
again after last remove.

[  504.135554] VFS: Dirty inode writeback failed for block device nvme0n1p1 (err=-5).

nvme_dev_disable(false) has been completed already before killing queues in
nvme_remove_dead_ctrl(), so both hw queue is stopped and nvmeq->cq_vector is
set as -1 in nvme_suspend_queue(). That means no new I/O(include IO in
fsync_bdev) can be submitted successfully any more, so looks it is reasonable
to kill queue in nvme_remove_dead_ctrl().

That is because .remove_work may not be run before del_gendisk() is
started even though the .reset_work is flushed, and we can't flush
.remove_work simply here.

Thanks,
Ming
