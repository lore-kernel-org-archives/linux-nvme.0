The first HMM variant find a hole and do not require a resource as input
parameter. Beside that internaly for PCIE device memory devm_memremap_pages()
does not do the right thing last time i check it always create a linear
mapping of the range ie HMM call add_pages() while devm_memremap_pages()
call arch_add_memory()

When i upstreamed HMM, Dan didn't want me to touch devm_memremap_pages()
to match my need. I am more than happy to modify devm_memremap_pages() to
also handle HMM needs.

Note that the intention of HMM is to be a middle layer between low level
infrastructure and device driver. Idea is that such impedance layer should
make it easier down the road to change how thing are handled down below
without having to touch many device driver.
