I remember documenting it at some point, but either it got lost
somewhere or I don't remember...

transport errors usually detected in soft-irq, so we queue up
err_work to:
1. stop + drain queues
2. fail inflight I/O.
3. queue delayed reconnect (reconnect_work)

Hmm, resets and reconnects are indeed similar, but one difference
is that in resets we do not fail fast inflight I/O as the expectation
is that the recovery should be immediate (it also matches pci with
that respect) while we consider reconnect something that can last
for a while so we fail fast to allow failover and continue reconnect
attempts quietly. Another difference is that failed reset results in
a controller removal while in reconnects we have to exhaust
ctrl_loss_tmo.

We could change things, like merging reconnect and reset and introduce
a concept of "on-host reset". Not sure it will be any less confusing
though...
