Good explanation :)

The IO transfer size is a bit more pressing on some devices (e.g.
cxgb3/4) where the number of pages per-MR can be indeed lower than
a reasonable transfer size (Steve can correct me if I'm wrong).

However, if there is a real demand for this we'll happily accept
patches :)

Just a note, having this feature in-place can bring unexpected behavior
depending on how we implement it:
- If we can use multiple MRs per IO (for multiple SGLs) we can either
prepare for the worst-case and allocate enough MRs to satisfy the
various IO patterns. This will be much heavier in terms of resource
allocation and can limit the scalability of the host driver.
- Or we can implement a shared MR pool with a reasonable number of MRs.
In this case each IO can consume one or more MRs on the expense of
other IOs. In this case we may need to requeue the IO later when we
have enough available MRs to satisfy the IO. This can yield some
unexpected performance gaps for some workloads.

Cheers,
Sagi.
