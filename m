My reading of the MIPS code was that only the 64-bit platforms use it,
but there are a number of 32-bit platforms that have 64-bit physical
addresses and don't.

32-bit ARM doesn't actually use SWIOTLB at all, despite selecting it
in Kconfig. I think Xen uses it for its own purposes, but nothing
else does.

Most ARM platforms can't actually have RAM beyond 4GB, and the ones
that do have it tend to also come with an IOMMU, but I remember
at least BCM53xx actually needing swiotlb on some chip revisions
that are widely used and that cannot DMA to the second memory bank
from PCI (!).
