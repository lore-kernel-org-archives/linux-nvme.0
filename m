Yes.

Because this request has been completed above by blk-mq timeout,
then this old request won't be completed any more via blk_mq_complete_request()
either from normal path or what ever, such as cancel.

No such issue since current blk-mq makes sure one req is only completed
once, but your patch changes to depend on driver to make sure that.
