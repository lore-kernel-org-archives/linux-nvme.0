This is specific to FC fail fast logic, nvme-rdma will fail inflight
commands as soon as the transport see an error (or keep alive timeout
expires).

It seems that FC wants to wait for the request retries counter to exceed
but given that the queue isn't unquiesced, the requests are quiesced
until the host will successfully reconnect.
