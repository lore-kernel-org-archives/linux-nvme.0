Count yourself lucky.

Well, I'd been surprised that it worked, too.
And even more so that Boris Piskenny @ Nvidia is actively working on it.

Which is precisely what we hope to discuss at LSF.
(Yes, I know, probably not the best venue to discuss network stuff ...)

Each approach has its drawbacks:

- Establishing sockets from userspace will cause issues during 
reconnection, as then someone (aka the kernel) will have to inform 
userspace that a new connection will need to be established.
(And that has to happen while the root filesystem is potentially 
inaccessible, so you can't just call arbitrary commands here)
(Especially call_usermodehelper() is out of the game)
- Having ULP helpers (as with this design) mitigates that problem 
somewhat in the sense that you can mlock() that daemon and having it 
polling on an intermediate socket; that solves the notification problem.
But you have to have ULP special sauce here to make it work.
- Moving everything in kernel is ... possible. But then you have yet 
another security-relevant piece of code in the kernel which needs to be 
audited, CVEd etc. Not to mention the usual policy discussion whether it 
really belongs into the kernel.

So I don't really see any obvious way to go; best we can do is to pick 
the least ugly :-(

Cheers,

Hannes
