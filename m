Subject: [PATCH 0/8] correct quiescing in several block drivers
Message-ID: <1499154912-10420-1-git-send-email-sagi@grimberg.me>

Before we either iterate on tags or cleanup the request queue
we must guarantee that the hw queues are stop and no inflight
.queue_rq is active. Thats what blk_mq_quiesce_queue is for, so
use it where appropriate.

Sagi Grimberg (8):
  nvme-rdma: quiesce/unquiesce admin_q instead of start/stop its hw
    queues
  nvme-fc: quiesce/unquiesce admin_q instead of start/stop its hw queues
  nvme-loop: quiesce/unquiesce admin_q instead of start/stop its hw
    queues
  nvme-pci: quiesce/unquiesce admin_q instead of start/stop its hw
    queues
  nbd: quiesce request queues to make sure no submissions are inflight
  mtip32xx: quiesce request queues to make sure no submissions are
    inflight
  virtio_blk: quiesce/unquiesce live IO when entering PM states
  xen-blockfront: quiesce IO before device removal
