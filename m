Right, that would be possible. But I'd rather not treat any requests
differently, it's a huge pain in the ass that flush request currently
insert with a driver tag already allocated. So it's not because
scheduling will add anything at all, it's more that I'd like to move
flush requests to use regular inserts as well and not deal with some
request being "special" in any way.

The below should hopefully work. Totally untested...
