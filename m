I'm still working through this.  I'll hopefully have a handful of
RFC-level changes by end of day Monday.  But could take longer.

One change that I already shared in a previous mail is:
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/snitzer/linux.git/commit/?h=devel2&id=99ebcaf36d9d1fa3acec98492c36664d57ba8fbd

What is your test workload?  If you can share I'll be sure to factor it
into my testing.

You've misunderstood what I said my null_blk (RAM) performance is.

My null_blk test gets ~1900K read IOPs.  But dm-mpath ontop only gets
between 600K and 1000K IOPs depending on $FIO_QUEUE_DEPTH and if I
use multiple $NULL_BLK_HW_QUEUES.

Here is the script I've been using to test:

#!/bin/sh

set -xv

NULL_BLK_HW_QUEUES=1
NULL_BLK_QUEUE_DEPTH=4096

DM_MQ_HW_QUEUES=1
DM_MQ_QUEUE_DEPTH=4096

FIO=/root/snitm/git/fio/fio
FIO_QUEUE_DEPTH=32
FIO_RUNTIME=10
FIO_NUMJOBS=12

PERF=perf
#PERF=/root/snitm/git/linux/tools/perf/perf

run_fio() {
    DEVICE=$1
    TASK_NAME=$(basename ${DEVICE})
    PERF_RECORD=$2
    RUN_CMD="${FIO} --cpus_allowed_policy=split --group_reporting --rw=randread --bs=4k --numjobs=${FIO_NUMJOBS} \
              --iodepth=${FIO_QUEUE_DEPTH} --runtime=${FIO_RUNTIME} --time_based --loops=1 --ioengine=libaio \
              --direct=1 --invalidate=1 --randrepeat=1 --norandommap --exitall --name task_${TASK_NAME} --filename=${DEVICE}"

    if [ ! -z "${PERF_RECORD}" ]; then
	${PERF_RECORD} ${RUN_CMD}
	mv perf.data perf.data.${TASK_NAME}
    else
	${RUN_CMD}
    fi
}

dmsetup remove dm_mq
modprobe -r null_blk

modprobe null_blk gb=4 bs=512 hw_queue_depth=${NULL_BLK_QUEUE_DEPTH} nr_devices=1 queue_mode=2 irqmode=1 completion_nsec=1 submit_queues=${NULL_BLK_HW_QUEUES}
