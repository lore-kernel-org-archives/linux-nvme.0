I definitely see much better results with bio-based over blk-mq.
For the multithreaded fio job Sagi shared I'm seeing bio-based ~2835K vs
blk-mq ~1950K (read IOPs).

Yeah, I was using some crap ioping test to get those 500K/85K results.
I've now switched to the fio test Sagi shared and am seeing:

~1950K IOPs with blk-mq nullb0, only ~310K with .request_fn dm-mpath
ontop, and ~955K with blk-mq dm-mpath ontop -- all read IOPs.

So at least now I can get my eye back on the prize of improving blk-mq
dm-multipath!
