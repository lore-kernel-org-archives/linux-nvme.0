Subject: [GIT PULL] nvme fixes for Linux 4.15
Message-ID: <20171129161621.ijlhfxjde6ke4r6p@infradead.org>

Hi Jens,

a few more nvme updates for 4.15.  A single small PCIe fix, and a number
of patches for RDMA that are a little larger than what I'd like to see
for -rc2, but they fix important issues seen in the wild.

The following changes since commit 6c4ca1e36cdc1a0a7a84797804b87920ccbebf51:

  bcache: check return value of register_shrinker (2017-11-24 16:23:01 -0700)

are available in the git repository at:
