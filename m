Just so you know ... and just in case others are watching.  You're not
going to be getting an invite to LSF/MM unless you send an attend or
topic request in as the CFP asks:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-fsdevel&m=148285919408577

The rationale is simple: it's to difficult to track all the "me too"
reply emails and even if we could, it's not actually clear what the
intention of the sender is.  So you taking the time to compose an
official email as the CFP requests allows the programme committee to
distinguish.
