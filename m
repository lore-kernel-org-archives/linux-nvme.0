This could be good.

What's also possible (see answer to my previous mail) is measuring the time it
takes for a completion to arrive and if the average time is lower than the
context switch time just busy loop insted of waiting for the IRQ to arrive. If
it is higher we can always schedule a timer to hit _before_ the IRQ will
likely arrive and start polling. Is this something that sounds reasonable to
you guys as well?
