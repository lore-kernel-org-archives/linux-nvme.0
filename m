Subject: [PATCH V2 0/5] nvme: pci: fix & improve timeout handling
Message-ID: <20180429154152.16656-1-ming.lei@redhat.com>

Hi,

The 1st patch introduces blk_quiesce_timeout() and blk_unquiesce_timeout()
for NVMe, meantime fixes blk_sync_queue().

The 2nd patch covers timeout for admin commands for recovering controller
for avoiding possible deadlock.

The other 3 patches fixes several races wrt. NVMe timeout handler, and
finally can make blktests block/011 passed.


Ming Lei (5):
  block: introduce blk_quiesce_timeout() and blk_unquiesce_timeout()
  nvme: pci: cover timeout for admin commands running in EH
  nvme: pci: only wait freezing if queue is frozen
  nvme: fix race between freeze queues and unfreeze queues
  nvme: pci: simplify timeout handling

V2:
	- fix draining timeout work, so no need to change return value from
	.timeout()
	- fix race between nvme_start_freeze() and nvme_unfreeze()
	- cover timeout for admin commands running in EH
