Looks no one mentioned the steps for reproduction, then it isn't easy
to understand the related use case, could anyone share the steps for
reproduction?

There are at least one case in which we have to use stop queues:

	- when QUEUE_BUSY(now it becomes BLK_STS_RESOURCE) happens, some drivers
	need to stop queues for avoiding to hurt CPU, such as virtio-blk, ...

It looks like the old way of scsi-mq, but scsi has removed this way and
avoids to stop queue.
