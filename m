Weird.  I did push back on those changes initially (just felt like
churn) but I ultimately did take them:

$ git log --oneline --author=bart drivers/md/dm-mpath.c
6599c84 dm mpath: do not modify *__clone if blk_mq_alloc_request() fails
4813577 dm mpath: change return type of pg_init_all_paths() from int to void
9f4c3f8 dm: convert wait loops to use autoremove_wake_function()

Did I miss any?

But to be 100% clear, I'm very appreciative of any DM mpath (and
request-based DM core) changes.  I'll review them with a critical eye
but if they hold up they get included.

Mike
