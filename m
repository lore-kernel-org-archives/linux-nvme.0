This:

static inline u32 t10_pi_ref_tag(struct request *rq)
{
        return blk_rq_pos(rq) >>
                (rq->q->integrity.interval_exp - 9) & 0xffffffff;
}

won't work for !CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INTEGRITY. I didn't want to make the
change, but looks like it should either return -1U as we the value
should mean nothing if BLK_DEV_INTEGRITY isn't set, or just ignore the
shift and return blk_rq_pos(rq) & 0xffffffff.

Please fixup and resend the series.
