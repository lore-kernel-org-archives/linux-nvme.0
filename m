Glad you're fine with it.  I thought you'd balk at this too.  Mainly
because I was unaware nvme_error_status() existed; so I thought any
amount of new NVMe error translation for upper-layer consumption would
be met with resistence.

Keith arrived at this approach based on an exchange we had in private.

I gave him context for DM multipath's need to access the code NVMe uses
to determine if an NVMe-specific error is retryable or not.  Explained
how SCSI uses scsi_dh error handling and
drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:__scsi_error_from_host_byte() to establish a
"differentiated IO error", and then
drivers/md/dm-mpath.c:noretry_error() consumes the resulting BLK_STS_*.

Armed with this context Keith was able to take his NVMe knowledge and
arrive at something you're fine with.  Glad it worked out.

Thanks,
Mike
