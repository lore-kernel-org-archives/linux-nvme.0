Ok, I'm still missing the big picture here. First question is what is 
the P2PDMA provider?

Second question is how to you want to handle things when device are not 
behind the same root port (which is perfectly possible in the cases I 
deal with)?

Third question why multiple clients? That feels a bit like you are 
pushing something special to your use case into the common PCI 
subsystem. Something which usually isn't a good idea.



As far as I can see we need a function which return the distance between 
a initiator and target device. This function then returns -1 if the 
transaction can't be made and a positive value otherwise.

We also need to give the direction of the transaction and have a 
whitelist root complex PCI-IDs which can handle P2P transactions from 
different ports for a certain DMA direction.
