Yeah good point, we need to carry it through. Reserved tags exist
because drivers often need a request/tag for error handling. If all
tags currently are used up for regular IO that is stuck, you need
a reserved tag for error handling to guarantee progress.

So Sagi's patch does take it half the way there, but get_driver_tag
really needs to know about this as well, or we will just get stuck
there as well. Two solutions, I can think of:

1) Check the tag value in get_driver_tag, add BLK_MQ_REQ_RESERVED
   when allocating a driver tag if above X.
2) Add an RQF_SOMETHING_RESERVED. Add BLK_MQ_REQ_RESERVED in
   get_driver_tag if that is set.

Comments?
