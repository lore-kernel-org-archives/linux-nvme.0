Yes, but the other CPU should belong to this irq's affinity, and if all
CPUs in the irq's affinity is DEAD, this irq vector will be shutdown,
and if there is in-flight IO or will be, then the completion for this
IOs won't be delivered to CPUs. And now seems we depend on queue's timeout
handler to handle them.

As I mentioned above, it shouldn't be strange to see in CPU offline/online
stress test.
