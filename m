So turns out that version is old and it has since changed:
https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_SWG_SIIS_Version_1_05_Revision_1_00.pdf
(section 5.5)

So in this document Cristoph is right. There is a single TPER for the entire device.
For devices with multiple namespaces, there will be a single global locking range.
That single locking range covers the entire LBA range. Other locking ranges aren't allowed.

Now, for a drive with one namespace There is a global LR and it MAY be allowed to have
other user locking ranges as well.

Now, with this in mind, it sort of makes sense to move this from block/ back into lib/
and interface with the character dev. Instead of passing around block_devices, we
can pass around struct file *'s.

Does anyone have and qualms/comments/anecdotes before I move everything around?
