We need the PAGE_SIZE upper bound because the "special" bvec only
allows a single page payload.  I can't find any indication that
the DSM command is limited to a single PRP, so not sure where a
ctrl->page_size would come from.  But now that I looked again there
is a hard limit of 256 entries due to NR being a 8-bit field, so
I need to cap on that at least.
