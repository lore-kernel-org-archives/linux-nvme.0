OK, this kind of failure during reset can be triggered in my test easily, then
nvme_remove_dead_ctrl() is called too, but not see IO hang from remove path.

As we discussed, it shouldn't be so, since queues are unquiesced &
killed, all IO should have been failed immediately. Also controller has
been shutdown, the queues are frozen too, so blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait()
won't wait on one unfrozen queue.

So could you post the debugfs log when the hang happens so that we may
find some clue?

Also, I don't think your issue is caused by this patchset, since
nvme_remove_dead_ctrl_work() and nvme_remove() aren't touched by this patch.
That means this issue may be triggered without this patchset too,
so could we start to review this patchset meantime?


Thanks,
Ming
