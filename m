It obviously depends what these functions do, but that remains true for
lots of other use cases applying to a shared memory location, if that's
the case. Also it happens that a lot of string functions that are used
as arguments to other ones are in fact lookups, skip, trim etc which
only manipulate the pointer and the length and not the contents.

Intermediate variables declared after statements remain an abomination
which turn a visual lookup from O(indent_levels) to O(lines) because
normally you only have to quickly glance a the previous opening brace
and if you don't find, you repeat, but with them you have to visually
scan every single line. They're now allowed for macros and iterators
which can make a good use of them but it's not a reason for abusing
them in code supposed to be reviewable by humans.

That point is the last of my concerns ;-)
