Recently I played fio over NVMe partition direclty with hot-remove too, and
found that d3cfb2a0ac0b8487d28(block: block new I/O just after queue is set
as dying) is helpful for this kind of issue.

Also the following patch fixes one issue in remove path.

So could you test v4.12-rc1(d3cfb2a0 is merged) with the above patch?

With these patches in, block layer & NVMe should make sure that all I/O can
be finished with -EIO before del_gendisk() returns once after hot-remove
is triggered, then the failure handling of fs might need further investigation.


Thanks,
