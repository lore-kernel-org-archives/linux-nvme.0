Sounds like your platform fundamentally doesn't support surprise link
down if it considers the event a fatal error. That's sort of what this
test was supposed to help catch so we know what platforms can do this
vs ones that can't.

The test does check that the slot is hotplug capable before running,
so it's supposed to only run the test on slots that claim to be capable
of handling the event. I just don't know of a good way to query platform
firmware to know what it will do in response to such an event.
