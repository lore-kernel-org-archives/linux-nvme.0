Section 5.2 clearly states that each AER comes with a log page to
clear it, and the above does not contain any language to explicitly
override it. So my reading of the spec is that to clear the event you need
to read the log page, but to find out what has changed you might issue
Identify commands instead.

> If target is not required to implement, then I guess your change should still work because if log page 04h fails, it fails back to rescan. Correct?

Independ of what the spec actually requires, the code tries to robust
as possible and falls back to doing the manual scan.

> I think you can optimize this by checking the "Log Page Identifier" field in your result and accordingly setting EVENT_NS_CHANGED. I assume target would clear this if log page 04h is not supported.

We can try that, but I'm not sure what it is going to buy us.
