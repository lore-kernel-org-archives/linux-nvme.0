Subject: [PATCH 2/6] nvme-pci: Fix queue freeze criteria on reset
In-Reply-To: <20180518163823.27820-1-keith.busch@intel.com>
References: <20180518163823.27820-1-keith.busch@intel.com>
Message-ID: <20180518163823.27820-2-keith.busch@intel.com>

The driver had been relying on the pci_dev to maintain the state of
the pci device to know when starting a freeze would be appropriate. The
blktests block/011 however shows us that users may alter the state of
pci_dev out from under drivers and break the criteria we had been using.

This patch uses the private nvme controller struct to track the
enabling/disabling state. Since we're relying on that now, the reset will
unconditionally disable the device on reset. This is necessary anyway
on a controller failure reset, and was already being done in the reset
during admin bring up, and is not harmful to do a second time.
