Yes. my WIP HMB patch uses DMA_ATTR_NO_KERNEL_MAPPING, although I'm
workin on x86 at the moment where it's a no-op.

Though about that - but in the end DMA_ATTR_NO_KERNEL_MAPPING implies
those, so instead of using lots of flags in driver I'd rather fix
up more dma_ops implementations to take advantage of
DMA_ATTR_NO_KERNEL_MAPPING.
