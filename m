Hello Keith,

Have you considered to introduce a fourth state for block layer requests to
avoid that completions that occur while a timeout handler is in progress get
lost? That would avoid that completions get lost not only for the NVMe driver
but also for SCSI drivers. See e.g. the MQ_RQ_TIMED_OUT state in
https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-block at vger.kernel.org/msg22196.html

Thanks,

Bart.
