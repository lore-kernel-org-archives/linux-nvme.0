The tags sharing fairness mechanism between different request_queues cannot work well here.
When timer is per-request_queue, if there is no request on one request_queue,
it could be idled. But now, with per-tagset timer, we cannot detect the idle one at all.

mod_delayed_work_on is very tricky in our scenario. It will grab the pending
work entry and queue it again.

delayed_work.timer trigger
queue_work timeout_work          delayed_work.timer not pending
                                 mod_delayed_work_on
                                   grab the pending timeout_work
                                 re-arm the timer

The timeout_work would not be run.
