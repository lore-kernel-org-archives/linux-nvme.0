I just tried to not make the 8th patch too big, but looks we have to
merge the two.

Once the EH kthread is introduced in 8th patch, there isn't such issue any more.

nvme_eh_reset() can move on, if controller state is either CONNECTING or
RESETTING, nvme_change_ctrl_state(&dev->ctrl, NVME_CTRL_RESETTING) won't
be called in nvme_eh_reset(), and nvme_pre_reset_dev() will be called
directly, then follows scheduling of the eh_reset_work.

There are actually two issues here, both are covered in this patchset:

1) when nvme_wait_freeze() is for draining IO, controller error may
happen again, this patch can shutdown & reset controller again to
recover it.

2) there is also another issue: queues may not be put into freeze state
in nvme_dev_disable(), then nvme_wait_freeze() will wait forever. This
issue is addressed by 4th patch.

Both two can be observed in blktests block/011 and verified by this patches.

Thanks for your great review, please let me know if there are other
issues.

Thanks,
Ming
