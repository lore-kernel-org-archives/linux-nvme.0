But this has a profound effect on the NVMe operation, because fo
example the NVMe reset cycle is tied into PCIe function states.

Please bring this issue up with the relevant standards comittee first,
otherwise we're getting us into a nightmare of undefined behavior here.

And it's not like Intel isn't active in this group.  I'd suggest you
talk to Amber who is the editor for both the AHCI and NVMe spec,
that should get you started.
