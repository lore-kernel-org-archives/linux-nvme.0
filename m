I agree, we should get that moving, and make a proper abstraction for 
it. Also with respect to how an SMR interface in general is integrated 
into NVMe.

The patch is necessary due to the revalidate event for retrieving the 
lba format from the nvme drive. It might not be available the first time 
around, and we have to hook in when the drive is revalidated the second 
time.
