As for the __nvme_find_ns_head function, can it lookup the namespace
globally, not in the current subsytem. Take hypermetro scenario for
example, two namespaces which should be viewed as the same namespaces
from the database application but exist in two different cities respectively.
Some vendors maybe specify those two namespaces with the same UUID.

In addition, could you add a switch to turn on/off finding namespaces in
a subsystem-wide level or globally?

Can namespace be shared between two subsystem?  If not, for hypermetro scenario,
we need keep more information of a storage array in city A synchronized with the other
in city B.
