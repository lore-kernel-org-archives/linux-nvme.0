Hi Ming

Thanks for your kindly response.

We have to consider another context, nvme_reset_work.
There are two contexts that will invoke nvme_pre_reset_dev.
nvme_eh_reset could invoke nvme_pre_reset_dev even if the state is RESETTING or CONNECTING.

nvme_error_handler                nvme_reset_ctrl
                                    -> change state to RESETTING
                                    -> queue reset work
                                  nvme_reset_work          
  -> nvme_dev_disable                                     
  -> nvme_eh_reset
    -> nvme_pre_reset_dev          -> nvme_pre_reset_dev
      -> change state to CONNECTING   -> change state fails
                                   -> nvme_remove_dead_ctrl
There seems to be other race scenarios between them.

Just invoke nvme_dev_disable in nvme_error_handler context and hand over the other things
to nvme_reset_work as the v2 patch series seems clearer.
The primary target of nvme_error_handler is to drain IOs and disable controller.
reset_work could take over the left things of the recovery work

IMO, modify the nvme_reset_ctrl_sync in nvme_error_handler to nvme_reset_ctrl should be ok.
If the admin ios in reset_work timeout, the nvme_error_handler could also provide help to complete them.

We could split the nvme_reset_work into two contexts instead of introduce another nvme_eh_reset.
Otherwise, the code looks really complicated.
In addition, this fix for this issue could be deferred after your great EH kthread solution is submitted.
