mips has lots of weird swiotlb wire-up in it's board code (the swiotlb
arch glue really needs some major cleanup..), as does arm.  Not
sure about the others.

Getting rid of highmem bouncing in the block layer will take some time
as various PIO-only drivers rely on it at the moment.  These should
all be convertable to kmap that data, but it needs a careful audit
first.  For 4.11 I'll plan to switch away from bouncing highmem by
default at least, though and maybe also convert a few PIO drivers.
