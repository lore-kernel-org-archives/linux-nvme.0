Good news is that I've managed to hit the roof for my array with the
devel2 version of those patches. (And a _heavily_ patched-up lpfc
driver :-)
So from that perspective everything's fine now; we've reached the
hardware limit for my setup.
Which in itself is quite impressive; beating Intel P3700 with 16FC
is not bad methinks :-)

So thanks for all your work here.

Cheers,

Hannes
