Subject: [PATCH 2/5] nvme: add new reconnecting controller state
In-Reply-To: <1467809752-31320-1-git-send-email-hch@lst.de>
References: <1467809752-31320-1-git-send-email-hch@lst.de>
Message-ID: <1467809752-31320-3-git-send-email-hch@lst.de>

The nvme fabric (RDMA, FC, etc...) can introduce port, link or node
failures that may require a reconnect to re-establish the connection.

Add a new reconnecting state that will initially be used by the RDMA
driver.
