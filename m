Correct, the VM has no concept of the host's IOMMU groups, only the
hypervisor knows about the groups, but really only to the extent of
which device belongs to which group and whether the group is viable.
Any runtime change to grouping though would require DMA mapping
updates, which I don't see how we can reasonably do with drivers,
vfio-pci or native host drivers, bound to the affected devices.  Thanks,
