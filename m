Absolutely, I agree we turn it on ASAP. ?I just don't want to be on the
receiving end of Linus' flamethrower because a bug we already had
reported against scsi-mq caused problems. ?Get confirmation from the
original reporters (or as close to it as you can) that their problems
are fixed and we're good to go; he won't kick us nearly as hard for new
bugs that turn up.
