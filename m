It's never been 4.20-rc based. After the initial merge, it got based
on a random commit in the merge window:

commit 3acbd2de6bc3af215c6ed7732dfc097d1e238503
Merge: d49f8a52b15b de7d83da84bd

    Merge tag 'sound-4.20-rc1' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound

and has been ever since.
