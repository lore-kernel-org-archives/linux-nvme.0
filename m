Maybe.  I need to look at the TCG spec again (oh my good, what a fucking
mess), but if I remember the context if it is the whole nvme controller
and not just a namespace, so a block_device might be the wrong context.
Then again we can always go from the block_device to the controller
fairly easily.  So instead of adding the security operation to the
block_device_operations which we don't really need for now maybe we
should add a security_conext to the block device so that we can avoid
all the lookup code?

Agreed.

Agreed.
