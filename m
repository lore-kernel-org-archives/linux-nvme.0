So, I gave those patches a spin.
Sad to say, they do _not_ resolve the issue fully.

My testbed (2 paths per LUN, 40 CPUs, 4 cores) yields 505k IOPs with
those patches.
Using a single path (without those patches, but still running
multipath on top of that path) the same testbed yields 550k IOPs.
Which very much smells like a lock contention ...
We do get a slight improvement, though; without those patches I
could only get about 350k IOPs. But still, I would somehow expect 2
paths to be faster than just one ..

Cheers,

Hannes
