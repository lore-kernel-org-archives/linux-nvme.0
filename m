Mind you, it _does_ work for PCI-NVMe:

# ls -l /sys/class/nvme/nvme0
total 0
-r--r--r--  1 root root 4096 Dec 14 11:14 cntlid
-r--r--r--  1 root root 4096 Dec 14 11:14 dev
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    0 Dec 14 11:14 device -> ../../../0000:45:00.0
-r--r--r--  1 root root 4096 Dec 14 11:14 firmware_rev
-r--r--r--  1 root root 4096 Dec 14 11:14 model
drwxr-xr-x 12 root root    0 Dec  3 13:43 nvme1n1
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root    0 Dec 14 11:14 power
--w-------  1 root root 4096 Dec 14 11:14 rescan_controller
--w-------  1 root root 4096 Dec 14 11:14 reset_controller
-r--r--r--  1 root root 4096 Dec 14 11:14 serial
-r--r--r--  1 root root 4096 Dec 14 11:14 state
-r--r--r--  1 root root 4096 Dec 14 11:14 subsysnqn
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    0 Dec  3 13:43 subsystem -> 
../../../../../../class/nvme
-r--r--r--  1 root root 4096 Dec 14 11:14 transport
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 4096 Dec 14 11:14 uevent

So it might be as simple as this patch:

diff --git a/drivers/nvme/host/fc.c b/drivers/nvme/host/fc.c
index feb86b59170e..1ecdec6b8b4a 100644
--- a/drivers/nvme/host/fc.c
+++ b/drivers/nvme/host/fc.c

nvmf_ctrl_options *opts,
          * Defer this to the connect path.
          */

-       ret = nvme_init_ctrl(&ctrl->ctrl, dev, &nvme_fc_ctrl_ops, 0);
+       ret = nvme_init_ctrl(&ctrl->ctrl, ctrl->dev, &nvme_fc_ctrl_ops, 0);
         if (ret)
                 goto out_cleanup_admin_q;


As for RDMA / TCP we're running on a network address which really isn't 
tied to a specific device, so we wouldn't have any device to hook on 
without some trickery.

Cheers,

Hannes
