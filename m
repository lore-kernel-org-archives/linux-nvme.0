Wouldn't help much, as the 'nvme_ns_id_attr_groups' needs to be a global
pointer anyway as it's references from drivers/nvme/host/core.c and
drivers/nvme/host/multipath.c.

While I have considered having nvme_nvm_register_sysfs() returning a
pointer I would then have to remove the 'static' declaration from the
nvm_dev_attr_group_12/20.
Which I didn't really like, either.

Cheers,
