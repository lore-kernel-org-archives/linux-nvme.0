blk_mq_nr_hw_queues=24 isn't likely to help you (but with these patches,
the first being the most important, it shouldn't hurt either provided
you have 24 cpus).

Could be you have multiple NUMA nodes and are seeing problems from that?

I have 12 cpus (in the same physical cpu) and only a single NUMA node.
I get the same results as blk_mq_nr_hw_queues=12 with
blk_mq_nr_hw_queues=4 (same goes for null_blk submit_queues).
I've seen my IOPs go from ~950K to ~1400K.  The peak null_blk can get on
my setup is ~1950K.  So I'm still seeing a ~25% drop with dm-mq (but
that is much better than the over 50% drop I saw seeing).

Not sure, I just emailed out all my patches (and cc'd you).  Please
verify you're using the latest here (same as 'dm-4.6' branch):
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/log/?h=for-next

I rebased a couple times... so please diff what you have tested against
this latest 'dm-4.6' branch.
