This patch is overly aggressive on failing allocated requests. There
are scenarios where we wouldn't want to abandon them, like if the hw
context is about to be brough back online, but this patch assumes all
need to be abandoned. I'll see if there's some other tricks we can have
a driver do. Thanks for the suggestions.
