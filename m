Actually, reading nvme_map_bio() (it's different since last I looked at
it) it looks like nvme should already be able to handle arbitrary size
bios?

I do intend to rework the blk_bio_map_sg() (or add a new one?) to
incrementally map as much of a bio as will fit in the provided
scatterlist, but it looks like nvme has some odd restrictions where it's
using BIOVEC_PHYS_MERGABLE()/BIOVEC_NOT_VIRT_MERGABLE() so I dunno if
it's worth bothering to try and have it use generic code.

However we don't need an explicit split here: if the sg fills up (i.e.
the places nvme_split_and_submit() is called), we can just mark the bio
as partially completed (set bio->bi_iter = iter, i.e. use the iterator
you passed to bio_for_each_segment), then increment bi_remaining (which
just counts completions, i.e. bio_endio() calls before the bio is really
completed) and resubmit the original bio. No need to allocate a split
bio, or loop over the bio again in bio_split().
