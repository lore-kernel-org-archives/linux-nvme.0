The OCSSD interface uses a couple of methods:

1) Piggy back soft ECC errors onto the completion entry. Tells the host
that a block properly should be refreshed when appropriate.
2) Use an asynchronous interface, e.g., NVMe get log page. Report blocks
through this interface that has been read disturbed. This may be coupled
with the various processes running on the SSD.
3) (That Ted suggested). Expose a "reset" bit in the Report Zones
command to let the host know which blocks should be reset. If the
plumbing for 2) is not available, or the information has been lost on
the host side, this method can be used to "resync".

Agree. depending on the use-case, one may expose a "perfect" interface
to the host, or one may expose an interface where media errors may be
reported to the host. The former case are great for consumer units,
where I/O predictability isn't critical, and similarly if I/O
predictability is critical, the media errors can be reported, and the
host may deal with them appropriately.
