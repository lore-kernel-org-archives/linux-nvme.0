It appears this isn't going to cause the path selection to failover for
the requeued work. The bio's bi_disk is unchanged from the failed path when the
requeue_work submits the bio again so it will use the same path, right? 

It also looks like new submissions will get a new path only from the
fact that the original/primary is being reset. The controller reset
itself seems a bit heavy-handed. Can we just set head->current_path to
the next active controller in the list?

Here, I think we need to reevaluate the path (nvme_find_path) and set
bio->bi_disk accordingly.
