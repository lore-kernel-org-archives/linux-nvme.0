I like your instincts, we just need to take them a bit further.

Splitting out the kernel's ANA log page parsing won't buy us much given
it is userspace (multipath-tools) that needs to consume it.  The less
work userspace needs to do (because kernel has already done it) the
better.

If the NVMe driver is made to always track and export the ANA state via
sysfs [1] we'd avoid userspace parsing duplication "for free".  This
should occur regardless of what layer is reacting to the ANA state
changes (be it NVMe's native multipathing or multipath-tools).

ANA and NVMe multipathing really are disjoint, making them tightly
coupled only serves to force NVMe driver provided multipathing _or_
userspace ANA state tracking duplication that really isn't ideal [2].

We need a reasoned answer to the primary question of whether the NVMe
maintainers are willing to cooperate by providing this basic ANA sysfs
export even if nvme_core.multipath=N [1].

Christoph said "No" [3], but offered little _real_ justification for why
this isn't the right thing for NVMe in general -- even when asked the
question gets ignored [4].

The inability to provide proper justification for rejecting a patch
(that already had one co-maintainer's Reviewed-by [5]) _should_ render
that rejection baseless, and the patch applied (especially if there is
contributing subsystem developer interest in maintaining this support
over time, which there is).  At least that is what would happen in a
properly maintained kernel subsystem.

It'd really go a long way if senior Linux NVMe maintainers took steps to
accept reasonable changes.
