To add my some cents from the SUSE perspective:
We have _quite_ some deployments on dm-multipathing, and most of our
customers are quite accustomed to setting up deployments with that.
It will be impossible to ensure that all customers and installation
scripts will _not_ try starting up multipathing, and for some scenarios
even preferring to use dm-multipath just because their tooling is geared
up for that.
So we absolutely need peaceful coexistence between dm-multipathing and
nvme multipathing. The precise level can be discussed (whether it being
a global on/off switch or some more fine-grained thingie), but we simply
cannot declare nvme multipathing being the one true way for NVMe.
The support-calls alone will kill us.

Note: this has _nothing_ to do with performance. I'm perfectly fine to
accept that dm-multipath has sub-optimal performance.
But that should not imply that it cannot be used for NVMe.

After all, Linux is about choice, not about forcing users to do things
in one way only.

Cheers,

Hannes
