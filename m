Ideally the queues are tied to CPUs, so you couldn't have one thread
submitting to a particular queue-pair while another thread is reaping
completions from it. Such a setup wouldn't get lock contention.

Some machines have so many CPUs, though, that sharing hardware queues
is required. We've experimented with separate submission and completion
locks for such cases, but I've never seen an improved performance as a
result.
