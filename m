IMO it is fine to change the change state in nvme_pre_reset_dev()
as the following way:

if (dev->ctrl.state != NVME_CTRL_CONNECTING)
	if (!nvme_change_ctrl_state(&dev->ctrl, NVME_CTRL_CONNECTING))
		goto out;

Also dev->reset_lock has been introduced, and we may hold it for
nvme_pre_reset_dev() in the path of nvme_reset_ctrl() too, then
there isn't the above race any more.

That way may not fix the current race: nvme_dev_disable() will
quiesce/freeze queue again when resetting is in-progress, then
nothing can move on.

One big change in V3 is to run nvme_dev_disable() & nvme_pre_reset_dev()
in the EH thread, and make sure queues are started once
nvme_pre_reset_dev() returns. But as you pointed, it may not work well
enough if admin requests are timed-out in nvme_pre_reset_dev().

Draining IOs isn't necessary, we can remove freezing queues & wait_freeze()
from nvme_dev_disable() & nvme_reset_work() for non-shutdown, that can be
easy to fix all these races since the .eh_reset_work isn't needed any more,
because quiescing is enough to prevent IOs from entering driver/device.

The only issue is that more requests may be failed when reset failed,
so I don't want to try that, and just follows the current behaviour.

IMO the primary goal of nvme EH is to recover controller, that is
what nvme_dev_disable() and resetting should do, if IO isn't drained,
timeout still may be triggered.

The big trouble is about percpu_ref, once the q_usage_counter is killed
to start freezing for preventing IO from entering block layer, we have
to run blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait() before unfreezing the usage couner. If
blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait() isn't needed, things can be much easier for us.

Right, that is one goal of this patchset.

Yeah, that is what I plan to do in V4, introduce .eh_pre_reset_work and
.eh_post_reset_work, and run the following things in .eh_pre_reset_work:

	- nvme_pre_reset_dev()
	- schedule .eh_post_reset_work

and run draining IO & updating controller state in .eh_post_reset_work.
.eh_pre_reset_work will be scheduled in nvme_error_handler().

This way may address the issue of admin req timeout in nvme_pre_reset_dev(),
what do you think of this approach?

Thanks,
Ming
