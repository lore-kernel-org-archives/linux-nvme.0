It is only NVMe and DM which use blk_mq_kick_requeue_list() in this way,
other drivers passes either ture or false to blk_mq_kick_requeue_list().

Yeah, looks DM need to switch to this way too.

Drivers may want to schedule at batch especially in fast path, so maybe
they should be allowed to use in splitting way.
