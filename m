I was thinking of allocating a tag from that hctx even if it had no
online cpu, the execution is done on an online cpu (hence the call
to blk_mq_alloc_request_hctx).

> Or I may understand you wrong, :-)

In the report we connected 40 hctxs (which was exactly the number of
online cpus), after Yi removed 3 cpus, we tried to connect 37 hctxs.
I'm not sure why some hctxs are left without any online cpus.

This seems to be related to the queue mapping.

Lets say I have 4-cpu system and my device always allocates
num_online_cpus() hctxs.

at first I get:
cpu0 -> hctx0
cpu1 -> hctx1
cpu2 -> hctx2
cpu3 -> hctx3

When cpu1 goes offline I think the new mapping will be:
cpu0 -> hctx0
cpu1 -> hctx0 (from cpu_to_queue_index) // offline
cpu2 -> hctx2
cpu3 -> hctx0 (from cpu_to_queue_index)

This means that now hctx1 is unmapped. I guess we can fix nvmf code
to not connect it. But we end up with less queues than cpus without
any good reason.

I would have optimally want a different mapping that will use all
the queues:
cpu0 -> hctx0
cpu2 -> hctx1
cpu3 -> hctx2
* cpu1 -> hctx1 (doesn't matter, offline)

Something looks broken...
