For example:

1) the 1st timeout event:

- nvme_dev_disable()
- reset
- scan_work

2) the 2nd timeout event:

nvme_dev_disable() may come just after nvme_start_queues() in
the above reset of the 1st timeout. And nvme_timeout() won't
schedule a new reset since the controller state is NVME_CTRL_CONNECTING.

Then scan_work in 1st timeout still may hang for ever.

Thanks,
Ming
