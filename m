Could you share me the link?

Firstly, the previous nvme_sync_queues() won't work reliably, so this
patch introduces blk_unquiesce_timeout() and blk_quiesce_timeout() for
this purpose.

Secondly, I remembered that you only call nvme_sync_queues() at the
entry of nvme_reset_work(), but timeout(either admin or normal IO)
can happen again during resetting, that is another race addressed by
this patchset, but can't cover by your proposal.

Thanks,
Ming
