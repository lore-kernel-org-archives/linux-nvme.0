I just realized that patch:

     blk-mq: Make blk_mq_reinit_tagset() calls easier to read

     Since blk_mq_ops.reinit_request is only called from inside
     blk_mq_reinit_tagset(), make this function pointer an argument of
     blk_mq_reinit_tagset() instead of a member of struct blk_mq_ops.
     This patch does not change any functionality but makes
     blk_mq_reinit_tagset() calls easier to read and to analyze.

Makes it impossible for me to move controller reset flow to
nvme-core without adding a trampoline (as the reinit_request
is transport specific)...

I'd really like to avoid adding more churn to the code refactoring
than it already has.

Given that this patch is not fixing anything should we revert it?
