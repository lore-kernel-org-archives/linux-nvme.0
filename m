That isn't true for multiple namespace case,  each request queue has its
own timeout work, and all these timeout work can be triggered concurrently.

Bart's rework on timeout won't cover the case of multiple namespace, so
we have to sync timeout inside driver.

The approach taken in my V4 has been simpler, could you take a look at it?
