Problem is that code is throttling the HW as HW cannot queue more completions until
SW get a chance to clear it. 

As an example:

for each in N
(
	blk_layer()
)
ring door bell

HW cannot queue new job until N x blk_layer operations are processed and queue
element ownership is passed to the HW after the loop. HW is just sitting idle
there if no queue entries are available.
