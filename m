Subject: Centralize nvme controller reset,
 delete and fabrics periodic reconnects
Message-ID: <1502790745-12569-1-git-send-email-sagi@grimberg.me>

This is the third part of the attempt to centralize controller reset,
delete and fabrics error recovery in nvme core.

As a reminder, the motivation is to get as much of the duplicate logic
existing in the various nvme transports to coommon code as possible.
We strive to have nvme core and fabrics modules take care of nvme and
fabrics constructs and initialization procedures and have our transports
simply worry about the underlying medium and spec extensions/enhancements.

This set is a step in that direction in the sense that it places a generic
controller initialization flows in nvme core, and converts two transports
to use common code.

The set is gradually reshaping nvme-rdma code to be more generic and then
simply move it to nvme-core (controller reset and delete) and nvme-fabrics
(error recovery and periodic reconnects). Then, nvme-loop is converted to
use nvme-core in one shot (Simply rip out all the duplicated logic).

Note that this patch set shouldn't break any transport that still does not
use it (pci, fc). The next part would be to take a stab at these transports
and add whatever is still needed to common code.

I tested this set with controller resets, deletes and error recovery in
the presence of I/O load. I tested rdma and loop.

Note that this direction got some exposure [1] and I tried to incorporate
feedback so if no hard objections are raised I plan to land this in 4.14.

This set applies on nvme-4.14 plus 4.13 recent fixes.
