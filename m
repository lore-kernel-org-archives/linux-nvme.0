EH may not cover this kind of failure, so it fails in the 1st try.

The above issue(hang in nvme_remove()) is still an old issue, which
is because queues are kept as quiesce during remove, so could you
please test the following change?

diff --git a/drivers/nvme/host/core.c b/drivers/nvme/host/core.c

        if (ctrl->state == NVME_CTRL_DEAD)
                nvme_kill_queues(ctrl);
+       else {
+               if (ctrl->admin_q)
+                       blk_mq_unquiesce_queue(ctrl->admin_q);
+               nvme_start_queues(ctrl);
+       }

        down_write(&ctrl->namespaces_rwsem);
        list_splice_init(&ctrl->namespaces, &ns_list);

BTW, in my environment, it is hard to trigger this failure, so not see
this issue, but I did verify the nested EH which can recover from error
in reset.

Thanks,
Ming
