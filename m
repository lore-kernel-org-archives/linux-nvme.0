I'll send a new version with uintptr_t for now, but having a proper
interface for this sounds like a good idea.

I've seen a couple of cases like this, and most but not
all actually want a __user pointer like this one. That seems
similar to the common ioctl use case where we want a user pointer
from an 'unsigned long', so we could use the same function for both,
like

static inline void __user *get_uptr(unsigned long arg)
{
	return (void __user *)arg;
}

With this definition, you can pass any scalar type (u64 or
unsigned long normally) and get the pointer, and we can
put that into include/linux/uaccess.h.
