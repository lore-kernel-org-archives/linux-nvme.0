Hi Keith,

This issue may probably be fixed by Jianchao's patch of 'nvme: pci: set nvmeq->cq_vector
after alloc cq/sq'[1] and my another patch of 'nvme: pci: unquiesce admin
queue after controller is shutdown'[2], and both two have been included in the
posted V6.

[2] https://marc.info/?l=linux-block&m=152644344805995&w=2

So please retest V6 and see if this issue can be addressed, if not,
could you share the debugfs log, then we might see where is wrong
from the log?

Thanks,
Ming
