Right.

At least with V3, the admin io submitted in reset_work won't be handled
well. When EH thread hangs in the sync admin io, nvme_eh_schedule()
can't wakeup the EH thread any more, then the admin io may hang forever
in reset_work. Then we have to run nvme_pre_reset_dev() in another
context.

Right, nvme_dev_disable() can guarantee forward progress, and we have to
make sure that nvme_dev_disable() is called when timeout happens.

OK, got it, sorry for misunderstanding your point.

Right.

But as you mentioned above, reset_work has to be splitted into two
contexts for handling IO timeout during wait_freeze in reset_work,
so single instance of nvme_reset_ctrl() may not work well.
