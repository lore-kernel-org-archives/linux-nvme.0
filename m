Meh, you're right.  It did build fine when I tested it based on Jens'
for-4.12/block + my nvme PR.  But it seems like the post-merge merge
branch doesn't have the previous mtip32xxx fix yet that is a prerequisite
for this change.  Jens:  any idea why?  I'm getting lost in the maze
of branches..

Yes, both you and I are.  It's "mtip32xx: use runtime tag to initialize
command header" which is in Jens' for-4.12/block tree, but not in the
post-merge one.

Yes, but that behavior is gone with the above patch, which was
necessary to support blk-mq I/O schedulers.
