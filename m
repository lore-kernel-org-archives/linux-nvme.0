Hi Ming,
I create 500 ns per 1 subsystem (using with CX4 target and C-IB 
initiator but also saw it in CX5 vs. CX5 setup).
The null deref happens when I remove all configuration in the target (1 
port 1 subsystem and 500 namespaces and nvmet modules unload) during 
traffic to 1 nvme device/ns from the intiator.
I get Null deref in blk_mq_flush_busy_ctxs function that calls 
sbitmap_for_each_set in the initiator. seems like the "struct 
sbitmap_word *word = &sb->map[i];" is null. It's actually might be not 
null in the beginning of the func and become null during running the 
while loop there.
