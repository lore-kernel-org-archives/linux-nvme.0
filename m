Let's consider the normal NVMe timeout code path:

1) one request is timed out;

2) controller is shutdown, this timed-out request is requeued from
nvme_cancel_request(), but can't dispatch because queues are quiesced

3) reset is done from another context, and this request is dispatched
again, and completed exactly before returning EH_HANDLED to blk-mq, but
its state isn't updated to COMPLETE yet.

4) then double completions are done from both normal completion and timeout
path.

Seems same issue exists on poll path.

Thanks,
Ming
