Yeah, it's going to create a bunch of churn, but it's probably worth
doing before merging because I think it will remove a bunch of
complexity (ie. the need for the whole p2p client infrastructure because
we now only need to worry about only one namespace at a time, instead of
needing to find a p2p device that works with all namespaces at once).

I'll try to get a v9 with this change published in the next day or two.
