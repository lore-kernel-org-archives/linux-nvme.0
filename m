I think you are right on this - even on x86 we must not create
cachable mappings of PCI BARs - there is no way that works the way
anyone would expect.

I think this series doesn't have a problem here only because it never
touches the BAR pages with the CPU.

BAR memory should be mapped into the CPU as WC at best on all arches..
