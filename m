The goto was really intended for handling totally broken contronllers,
which isn't the case if someone requested to remove the pci device while
we're initializing it. Point taken, though, let me run a few tests and
see if there's a better way to handle this condition.

That should get it unstuck, but it will error all the IO that fsync_bdev
would probably rather complete successfully.

Question though, why doesn't the remove_work's nvme_kill_queues in
its current place allow forward progress already?
