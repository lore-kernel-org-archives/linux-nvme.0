Hi ming

Sorry for delayed report this.

In theory, the irq affinity will be migrated to other cpu. This is done by
fixup_irqs() in the context of stop_machine.
However, in my test, I found this log:

[  267.161043] do_IRQ: 7.33 No irq handler for vector

The 33 is the vector used by nvme cq.
The irq seems to be missed and sometimes IO hang occurred.
It is not every time, I think maybe due to nvme_process_cq in nvme_queue_rq.

I add dump stack behind the error log and get following:
