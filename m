It seems people miss-understand HMM :( you do not have to use all of
its features. If all you care about is having struct page then just
use that for instance in your case only use those following 3 functions:

hmm_devmem_add() or hmm_devmem_add_resource() and hmm_devmem_remove()
for cleanup.

You can set the fault callback to an empty stub that always do return
VM_SIGBUS or a patch to allow NULL callback inside HMM.

You don't have to use the free callback if you don't care and if there
is something that doesn't quite match what you want HMM can always be
ajusted to address this.

The intention of HMM is to be useful for all device memory that wish
to have struct page for various reasons.
