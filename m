I may not understand your point, once blk_sync_queue() returns, the
timer itself is deactivated, meantime the synced .nvme_timeout() only
returns EH_NOT_HANDLED before the deactivation.

That means this timer won't be expired any more, so could you explain
a bit why timeout can come again after blk_sync_queue() returns.

Thanks,
Ming
