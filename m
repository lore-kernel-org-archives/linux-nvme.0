Well, this is more a technical detail while we continue to harp about 
'sync' vs 'non-sync'.
Currently all instances of ->create_ctrl() are running asynchronously,
ie ->create_ctrl() returns a 'ctrl' object which is still in the process
of establishing the connection.
(And there it doesn't really matter whether it's FC or TCP/RDMA; FC is 
kicking of a workqueue for the 'reconnect' call, whereas TCP/RDMA is 
creating the association and issues the actual 'connect' NVMe SQE via
an I/O workqueue; net result is identical).
And when we talk about 'sync' connect we are planning to _wait_ until
this asynchronous operation reaches a steady state, ie either after the 
connect attempts succeeded or after the connect retries are exhausted.

And yes, we _are_ aware that this might be a quite long time.

Again, we do _not_ propose to change any of the default settings.
The 'sync' option will not modify the reconnect settings, it will just 
wait until a steady state it reached.

You assume correctly. That's why it'll be an additional option.
