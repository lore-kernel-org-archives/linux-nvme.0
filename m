Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] libmultipath: Fixes for NVME / NVMEoF
Message-ID: <20170718072916.24275-1-mwilck@suse.com>

Current code fails to set up multipath maps for NVME devices in a
Linux target/Linux host combination. This series enables at least
basic operation.

Patch 1/4 fixes a crash that happens if over-long WWIDs are encountered, and
is not specific to NVME as such. Patch 2/4 drops
the broken test uevent_can_discard_by_devpath(). Patch 3/4 compensates
for the additional event processing required by 2/4. Patch 4/4 mangles
overlong "nvme.*" WWIDs to make them usable for multipath (related discussion
in [1]; WWID_SIZE can't be simply increased because it has to match
device mapper's DM_NAME_LEN).

Changes wrt v1:
 1/4: assure 0-termination by using strlcpy() (Bart van Assche)
 4/4: drop extra length test (Ben Marzinski)

I kept the v1 Reviewed-by: and Acked-by tags because the changes are minor,
I hope that's ok for the reviewers.
