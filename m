If we get to choose, my preference would be to restore the old behavior
because currently existing nvme transports keep their internal ctrl
representation in the tagset->driver_data as they implement
init/exit_request. Bouncing in nvme core would require to change that
and always keep struct nvme_ctrl as the tagset->driver_data and convert
it on every handler...

Everything is doable but it seems like an unneeded hassle to me...
