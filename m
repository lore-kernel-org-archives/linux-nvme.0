I agree,

I do think though that this should be driven from the driver, because
for fabrics, we might have some fabric error that triggers a periodic
reconnect. So the "hw context is about to be brought back" is unknown
from the driver pov, and when we delete the controller (because we give
up) this is exactly where we need to abandon the allocated requests.
