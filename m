Yeah, I understand. It depends if there are real use cases in which
system can't be rebooted, but sometimes CPUs need to be added or removed
for some reasons. Looks CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU addresses this requirement,

Unfortunately I don't see the Reset comes when new CPU cores becomes
online.

Yes, I can add the new CPUs in console of Qemu, and these CPUs become
present first in VM, then switched online via command line after the hotplug,
but number of hw queues doesn't change.
