Subject: [PATCH 0/3] nvme suspend/resume fix
Message-ID: <1488396132-11369-1-git-send-email-keith.busch@intel.com>

Hi Jens,

This is hopefully the last version to fix nvme stopping blk-mq's CPU
event from making forward progress. The solution requires a couple new
blk-mq exports so the nvme driver can properly sync with queue states.

Since this depends on the blk-mq parts, and if you approve of the
proposal, I think it'd be easiest if you can take this directly into
linux-block/for-linus. Otherwise, we can send you a pull request if you
Ack the blk-mq parts.

The difference from the previous patch is an update that Artur
confirmed passes hibernate on a stacked request queue. Personally,
I tested this for several hours with fio running buffered writes
in the back-ground and rtcwake running suspend/resume at intervals.
This succeeded with no fio errors.

Keith Busch (3):
  blk-mq: Export blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait
  blk-mq: Provide queue freeze wait timeout
  nvme: Complete all stuck requests
