Hello Christoph,

As you know with configfs it is not allowed to create directories in the 
configfs hierarchy from inside the kernel. This means that users will 
have to create one directory per fabric port before configuring a target 
port. Other virtual filesystems, e.g. sysfs, allow directory creation by 
kernel drivers. This means that with sysfs the fabric port directory 
could be created by the nvmet driver. Is this how you want the nvmet 
driver to work?

Thanks,

Bart.
