But it can't avoid the race I mentioned, since nvme_dev_disable() can
happen again during resetting.

That is too risky, since the IO during resetting isn't much different
with IOs submitted from other IO paths.

For example, in case of blktests block/011, controller shouldn't have
been put into dead, and this patchset(V4 & V5) can cover this case well.
