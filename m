Actually, double checking, one of them is a little suspicious:

        if (a == &dev_attr_uuid.attr) {
<<<<<<< HEAD
                if (uuid_is_null(&ns->uuid) &&
                    !memchr_inv(ns->nguid, 0, sizeof(ns->nguid)))
=======
                if (uuid_is_null(&ids->uuid) ||
                    !memchr_inv(ids->nguid, 0, sizeof(ids->nguid)))
>>>>>>> 34a9690712aa386fb5fa9e3b8fb44a22f5f2aec6
                        return 0;
        }

with the previous copy using is_null && memchr_inv, the change to ids
makes it an OR instead. I'm going with the latter, but thought I'd bring
it up.
