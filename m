Keith demonstrated what it takes to support NVMe with dm.  He also
gave a couple presentations on it in addition to various ptches on
the list.

Again let's look at what multipathing involves:

 - discovery of multiple paths for a device, and path preferences:
   Storage protocol specific

 - handling of path state and grouping changes:
   Storage protocol specific

 - handling of path up / down events:
   Storage protocol / transport specific if provided

 - keep alive / path checking:
   Storage protocol specific with possible generic fallback

 - path selection:
   Generic, although building heavily on protocol / transport specific
   information

So most of the hard work is transport specific anyway.  And I fully
agree that generic code should be, well generic.  And with generic
I mean right in the block layer instead of involving a layer block
driver that relies on lots of low-level driver information and setup
from user space.

Great.

I think we'll need to have a quick fix for that ASAP, though.

Yes, error translation for the block layer, but most importantly
discovery of multiple paths to the same namespace.
