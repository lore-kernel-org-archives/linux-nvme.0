The important bit is that we need to fix this issue quickly.  We are
past -rc5 so I'm rather concerned about anything too complicated.

I'm not even sure SCSI has a problem with multiple completions happening
at the same time, but it certainly has a problem with bypassing
blk_mq_complete_request from the EH path.

I think we can solve this properly, but I also think we are way to late
in the 4.18 cycle to fix it properly.  For now I fear we'll just have
to revert the changes and try again for 4.19 or even 4.20 if we don't
act quickly enough.
