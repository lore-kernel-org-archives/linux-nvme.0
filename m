That's a make_request_fn stacking driver, right? There should be
no impact in that case, since the change above affects only mq.

I'm actually a little puzzled why md calls blk_sync_queue. Are the
queue timers ever used for bio-based drivers?

Good point. I missed that this needs to hold the tag_list_lock.

I think so. I wanted to keep blk_add_timer relatively unchanged for this
proposal, so I followed the existing pattern with the timer kicking the
work. I don't see why that extra indirection is necessary, so I think
it's a great idea. Unless anyone knows a reason not to, we can collapse
this into a single delayed work for both mq and legacy as a prep patch
before this one.

Thanks for the feedback!
