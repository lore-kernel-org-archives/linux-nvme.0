As we discussed this nvme time issue before, I have pointed out that
this is because of blk_mq_unfreeze_queue()'s limit which requires that
unfreeze can only be done when this queue ref counter drops to zero.

For this nvme timeout case, we may relax the limit, for example,
introducing another API of blk_freeze_queue_stop() as counter-pair of
blk_freeze_queue_start(), and simply switch the percpu-ref to percpu mode
from atomic mode inside the new API.

Frankly speaking, IMO, it may not be an good idea to mess up the fast path
just for handling the extremely unusual timeout event. The same is true
for doing the preemp only stuff, as you saw I have posted patchset for
killing it.

Thanks,
