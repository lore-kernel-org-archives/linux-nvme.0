The point of blk-mq is to provide all the functionality that drivers
need, even if it is for just a single driver. Functionality that can be
removed from drivers is good. The smaller/simpler we can make the
driver, the better off we are, even if that means adding a bit of
complexity to the core.

Obviously this is a case-by-case decision. For this particular case, I'm
happy with either solution.
