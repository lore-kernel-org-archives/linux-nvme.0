Sounds like you're not using mdadm to remove the disk. So why do you
expect mdadm to stop the array immediately? It doesn't know anything is
wrong until it trips over the missing disk.

Is your array linear or striped? If it's striped, I would expect it to
fall over in a heap very quickly. If it's linear, it depends whether you
remove drive 0 or drive 1. If you remove drive 0, it will fall over very
quickly. If you remove drive 1, the fuller your array the quicker it
will fall over (if your array isn't very full, drive 1 may well not be
used in which case the array might not fall over at all!)

Note that raid-0 is NOT redundant. Standard advice is "if a drive fails,
expect to lose your data". So the fact that your array limps on should
be the pleasant surprise, not that it blows up in ways you didn't expect.
