Subject: [PATCH v2 04/10] nvme/core: add NVME_CTRL_SUSPENDED controller state
In-Reply-To: <20190502114801.23116-1-mlevitsk@redhat.com>
References: <20190502114801.23116-1-mlevitsk@redhat.com>
Message-ID: <20190502114801.23116-5-mlevitsk@redhat.com>

This state will be used by a controller that is going to
suspended state, and will later be used by mdev
framework to detect this and flush its queues
