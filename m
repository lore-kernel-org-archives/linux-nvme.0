Right, perf (with default events) isn't the right tool to track this down.

But I'm seeing something that speaks to you not running with the first
context switching fix (which seems odd):

As you can see here:
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=for-next&id=a5b835282422ec41991c1dbdb88daa4af7d166d2

rq_completed() shouldn't be calling blk_mq_run_hw_queues() with the
latest code.

Please triple check you have the latest code, e.g.:
git diff snitzer/devel2
