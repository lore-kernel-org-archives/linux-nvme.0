Christoph,

This is really taking a lot into the nvme driver. I'm not sure if
this approach will be used in other block driver, but would it
make sense to place the block_device node creation, the make_request
and failover logic and maybe the path selection in the block layer
leaving just the construction of the path mappings in nvme?
