OK, I found that queue_mode=0 (bio-based) is _much_ faster than blk-mq
(2, the default).  Improving to ~950K read IOPs and ~675K write IOPs (on
the single numa node system).

Default for irqmode is 1 (softirq).  2 (timer) yields poor results.  0
(none) seems slightly slower than 1.

And if I use completion_nsec=1 I can bump up to ~990K read IOPs.

Seems the best, for IOPs, so far on this system is with:
modprobe null_blk gb=4 bs=4096 nr_devices=1 queue_mode=0 irqmode=1 completion_nsec=1 submit_queues=4
