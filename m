Host-aware SMR drives already have GC internally implemented (for cases
when the host does not write sequentially). Host-managed drives do not.
As for moving an application specific GC code into the device, well,
code injection in the storage device is not for tomorrow, and likely not
ever.

There are however other clever ways to reduce GC related host overhead
with basic commands. For SCSI, these may be WRITE SCATTERED, EXTENDED
COPY, and some others can greatly improve overhead over a simple
read+write loop. A better approach to GC offload may not be a "GC"
command, but something more generic for moving around LBAs internally
within the device. That is, if existing commands are not satisfactory.

Best.
