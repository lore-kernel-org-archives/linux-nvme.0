Sure, that is how dma_addr_t is supposed to work - it is always a
device specific value that can be used only by the device that it was
created for, and different devices could have different dma_addr_t
values for the same memory. 

So when Logan goes and puts dma_addr_t into the block stack he must
also invert things so that the DMA map happens at the start of the
process to create the right dma_addr_t early.

I'm not totally clear if this series did that inversion, if it didn't
then it should not be using the dma_addr_t label at all, or refering
to anything as a 'dma address' as it is just confusing.

BTW, it is not just offset right? It is possible that the IOMMU can
generate unique dma_addr_t values for each device?? Simple offset is
just something we saw in certain embedded cases, IIRC.
