Turns out that wasn't what patch 2 was. And the code is right there
above as well, and under the q_lock, so I guess that race doesn't
exist.

But that does bring up the fact if we should always be doing the
nvme_process_cq(nvmeq) after IO submission. For direct/hipri IO,
maybe it's better to make the submission path faster and skip it?
