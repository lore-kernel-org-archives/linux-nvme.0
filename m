Do you have any code describing this in more detail?  We could add the
read side as well if there is strong interest.

The API can be used by file systems, and my upcoming NFS SCSI layout
support was the main reason to write this.

Yes, but having it as a specific API isn't any less dangerous than
having it issued using SG_IO.  Reservations really only make sense if
you assume every user of a LU is actually cooperating in some way
and not actively hostile.
