Presumably because they have historically never tried to be
inter-operable with the block layer or drivers outside graphics and
RDMA.

Please spell out the value, it is not immediately obvious to me
outside of some memory capacity savings.

That's not the conclusion I arrived at because pfn_t is specifically
an opaque type precisely to force "unsuspecting" code to throw
compiler assertions. Instead pfn_t was dealt its death blow here:

...and I think that feedback also reads on this proposal.

My primary concern with this is that ascribes a level of generality
that just isn't there for peer-to-peer dma operations. "Peer"
addresses are not "DMA" addresses, and the rules about what can and
can't do peer-DMA are not generically known to the block layer. At
least with a side object there's a chance to describe / recall those
restrictions as these things get passed around the I/O stack, but an
undecorated "DMA" address passed through the block layer with no other
benefit to any subsystem besides RDMA does not feel like it advances
the state of the art.

Again, what are the benefits of plumbing this RDMA special case?
