Please refer to the following segment:

static int nvme_create_queue(struct nvme_queue *nvmeq, int qid)
{
	struct nvme_dev *dev = nvmeq->dev;
	int result;
...
	nvmeq->cq_vector = dev->num_vecs == 1 ? 0 : qid;
	result = adapter_alloc_cq(dev, qid, nvmeq);
	if (result < 0)
		goto release_vector;

	result = adapter_alloc_sq(dev, qid, nvmeq);   // if timeout and failed here
	if (result < 0)
		goto release_cq;

	nvme_init_queue(nvmeq, qid);
	result = queue_request_irq(nvmeq);
	if (result < 0)
		goto release_sq;

	return result;

 release_sq:
	dev->online_queues--;
	adapter_delete_sq(dev, qid);
 release_cq:                                        // we will be here !
	adapter_delete_cq(dev, qid);                // another cq delete admin command will be sent out.
 release_vector:
	nvmeq->cq_vector = -1;
	return result;
}

This cq delete admin command is sent out after EH 1 nvme_dev_disable completed and failed the
previous timeout sq alloc admin command. please refer to the code segment above.
