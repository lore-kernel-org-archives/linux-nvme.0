I agree that it should've been part of the initial series. As mentioned
above, I wasn't much apart of that earlier discussion in the series, and
hence missed that it was missing. And as also mentioned, LSM isn't much
on my radar as nobody I know uses it. This will cause oversights, even
if they are unfortunate. My point is just that no ill intent should be
assumed here.

I did author the basic framework of it, but Kanchan took over driving it
to completion and was the one doing the posting of it at that point.
It's not like I merge code I'm not aware of, we even discussed it at
LSFMM this year and nobody brought up the LSM oversight. Luis was there
too I believe.

The lack of awareness refers to the LSM side, not io_uring obviously.
I'm very much aware of what code I merge and have co-authored, goes
without saying.

I guess it's just somewhat lack of interest, since most of us don't have
to deal with anything that uses LSM. And then it mostly just gets in the
way and adds overhead, both from a runtime and maintainability point of
view, which further reduces the motivation.

I don't think it's an effort to avoid the LSM community.

For this particular case, I do agree that it should've been picked up
and been apart of the initial merge. I'll keep a closer eye on that in
the future.

Right, we agree on that, and I already did send an ack on the v2 of the
patch. Just be aware that it, as of now. depends on the io_uring tree
and won't apply cleanly to 5.19-rc, as mentioned in that reply too.
