Being one of the persons who has to backport a lot of NVMe code to older
kernels I'm not a huge fan of renaming nmve_ns.

That said, I don't have a better name for nvme_ns_head (yet) but I'll try to
think of one as well. OTOH looking at nvme_ns_head it actaully is the list
head of the nvme_ns list.
