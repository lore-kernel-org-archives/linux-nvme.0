something like this:

/**
  * t10_pi_prepare() - prepate PI prior submitting request to device
  * @rq:               request with PI that should be prepared
  * @protection_type:  PI type (Type 1/Type 2/Type 3)
  *
  * Description:
  *    For Type 1/Type 2, the virtual start sector is the one that was
  *    originally submitted by the block layer for the ref_tag usage. Due to
  *    partitioning, MD/DM cloning, etc. the actual physical start sector is
  *    likely to be different. Remap protection information to match the
  *    physical LBA.
  *
  *    Type 3 does not have a reference tag so no remapping is required.
