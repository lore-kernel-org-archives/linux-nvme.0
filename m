Let's just improve/fix the test case. Sounds like the 'enable' sysfs
attribute should never have been exported, and hence the test should
never have used it. blktests is not the source of truth, necessarily,
and it would be silly to work around cases in the kernel if it's a
clear case of "doctor it hurts when I shoot myself in the foot".
